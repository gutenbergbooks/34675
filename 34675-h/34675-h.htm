<h2>PREFACE</h2>
</div>
<p>These pages describe the adventures of men
whom duty or inclination has brought into
contact with the Indians of the entire American
continent; and, since every day sees the red race
diminishing, or abandoning the customs and mode of
life once characteristic of it, such adventures must
necessarily relate mainly to a bygone generation.</p>
<p>To-day the Indians form a bare sixtieth of the
American population, a falling off for which the
colonist has been responsible both actively and
involuntarily. The history of the red man&rsquo;s relations
to those who ultimately were to be his rulers is a
painful one; massacres and cruelties on the one
side led to reprisals of a similar nature on the other.
Happily the days of persecution and revolt are now
ended; some few of the natives have intermarried
with whites and have adapted themselves to the
conditions of modern civilisation; others have settled
down to an inoffensive and gypsy-like life on reserves
granted by the white governments. Meanwhile the
whole race&mdash;particularly in the north&mdash;continues to
diminish. It is not improbable that in the days of
Cortez and Pizarro the Indians were already a dying
people; and that collision with the white invaders
only hastened their demise. The result of this collision
is melancholy, and the author of &ldquo;Westward Ho!&rdquo;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_8' name='page_8'></a>8</span>
has put it all into a nutshell. &ldquo;The mind of the
savage, crushed by the sight of the white man&rsquo;s
superior skill, and wealth, and wisdom, loses at first
its self-respect, while his body, pampered with easily-obtained
luxuries, instead of having to win the necessaries
of life by heavy toil, loses its self-helpfulness;
and with self-respect and self-help vanish all the
savage virtues.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bishop Bompas, who spent his life among the
Indians of the far north, says, &ldquo;the whole of the
Tenni race seem to be of a sickly habit, and are
dwindling in numbers. They are not much addicted
to ardent spirits, nor are these now supplied to them,
but they have an inveterate propensity to gamble.
Though almost wholly free from crimes of violence,
and not much inclined to thieve, yet heathen habits
still cling to them, and they exhibit the usual Indian
deficiency in a want of stability and firmness of character....
In sickness the Indians are very pitiful.
They soon lose heart, and seem to die more fro
despondency than disease. The constant removals
are trying to the weak and infirm, and in times of
distress those who cannot follow the band are left
behind to perish.... The old women employ themselves
in twisting grass or roots or sinew into twine for
sewing or fishing-nets. The men and boys are often
busied in shaping bows, arrows, snowshoes, and
sledges.... Their capacity for civilisation is very
limited; none become business men.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>
<h3>CHEROKEE WARFARE</h3>
</div>
<p>It has been said by certain historians that, after
the American War of Independence, British
agents were employed not only to poison the minds
of those Siouan and Iroquoian tribes that dwelt on
the United States side of the Boundary, but even to
keep them supplied with rifles and ammunition.</p>
<p>Be that as it may, it is certainly a fact that, in 1793,
the Cherokee and Seneca tribes of the Iroquois were
not only at war with the Crows, Iowas, etc., of the
rival Sioux faction, but were turning their mysteriously
obtained rifles on the white people of the States;
and the celebrated General Wayne was sent into Ohio
with a strong force of cavalry and infantry to restore
order. He pitched his camp near Fort Jefferson, on
Lake Erie, and having driven away the insurgents,
sent a hundred foot-soldiers, under Lieutenants Lowry
and Boyd, across the lake to a fort near Detroit, to
bring back by road three hundred horses and extra
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_18' name='page_18'></a>18</span>
provisions, and, incidentally, to disarm any quarrelsome
redskins they might meet with.</p>
<p>The return march was destined to be a very unpleasant
one. Large and small bodies of the Indians whom
Wayne had driven to the forests persistently harried
the column, flank and rear, firing from behind rocks
and among the trees, till, in a couple of days, the
hundred men had become only seventy, and many
of the horses had escaped or been stolen. At noon
on the third day the men halted for dinner on a
barren tract between a range of hills and a thick
forest; and, in order to guard against a surprise,
Lieutenant Boyd with twenty men was sent to patrol
the woods while the rest ate their meal in comfort.
Half an hour later, while Lieutenant Lowry was preparing
to send another twenty men to relieve the
scouts, the report of a gun, followed quickly by a
dozen others, warned him that the day was not to be
gone through without further trouble.</p>

<span class='smcap'>A Gallant Rescue</span><br />
<br />
Lieutenant Boyd had been sent with twenty men to patrol the wood while the main body ate their meal. Presently shots were heard, and Sergeant Munson was sent to bring back an immediate report. He found the Lieutenant trying to bind his shattered leg. Shooting the foremost redskin, the Sergeant mounted the officer on his back and, after several narrow escapes, brought him into camp.<br />
</p>
</div>
<p>Every soldier caught up his rifle and made ready
to defend the horses and stores which had been placed
in the centre of the camp. Lowry called a couple of
sergeants to him and pointed to the new patrol.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take these to Mr. Boyd&rsquo;s assistance; and you,
Munson&rdquo; (to the younger sergeant) &ldquo;bring me back
word of what is going on. Hark at that!&rdquo; A rapid,
running fire was beginning, and above Boyd&rsquo;s voice,
which was shouting directions or encouragement to
his men, there rose the truly fearful war-whoop peculiar
to the Cherokee Indians. &ldquo;Hurry; off with you!
I&rsquo;ve enough men here to guard the horses in case&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The little squad plunged into the wood and made
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_19' name='page_19'></a>19</span>
for the scene of action, which could not be far away,
judging by the distinctness of the voices. They
arrived after a minute&rsquo;s quick double, and the sight
that awaited them was not an encouraging one. Ten
of their comrades were already dead or dying; the
rest were fighting desperately against a score of
Indians, most of whom were armed with rifles in
addition to their bows and hatchets, while, leaning
back against a tree, and doing his best to cheer on the
survivors, sat Lieutenant Boyd, his shin-bone shattered
by a bullet.</p>
<p>The new-comers fired a volley; several Indians
fell, and the rest were speedily charged with fixed
bayonets. Again came the horrible war-whoop, this
time from a second batch of Indians who either had
just arrived or had been in hiding, and these hastened
to pour flight after flight of arrows into the rescuers
from behind.</p>
<p>Young Munson, who was now fighting on the right
wing of the little force, turned swiftly, and, firing off
the charge which he had just rammed down, shot the
foremost of the bowmen. But, even as he started to
reload, he remembered his officer&rsquo;s command to return
at once with news; in the hurry and excitement of the
last few minutes he had forgotten all about it. He
looked round for the quickest exit from the wood,
and, in so doing, caught sight of Boyd who, faint with
the loss of blood, had been feebly endeavouring
to bandage his wound with a handkerchief. The
sergeant threw one more glance back at the soldiers;
many of them had already fallen before the Indian
arrows, and the rest, paying no attention to their new
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_20' name='page_20'></a>20</span>
assailants, were pursuing those who had guns. Then
he turned again to the officer. To leave him here was
to abandon him to death, perhaps by torture.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you get on my back, sir? he said hurriedly.
Quick; the redskins&rsquo;ll be on us in another minute.
Here, give me a hold of your pistol; I must leave my
rifle unless you can carry it for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the officer had scarcely strength enough to
enable him to stand. With difficulty Munson hauled
him upright against the tree-trunk, snatched up the
pistol in case he should need it on the perilous little
journey which he was undertaking, and, hoisting
Boyd on his back, darted among the trees out of
sight of the approaching Indians. On every side of
him shooting seemed to be going on; an arrow fell
at his very feet, and the next moment a stray musket-ball
flattened itself against the tree which he was
passing. What he could not understand was that,
the nearer he came with his burden to the camp,
the louder and more frequent did the firing sound.
Had his mates already driven the enemy into the
open?</p>
<p>A few steps more and he would be out of the wood.
But what was all this prancing and stamping? The
horses could hardly have broken loose, for, since
his recent losses, Lowry had had them tethered in
batches whenever a halt of any length was made.
The firing grew louder and faster than ever, and all
doubt in his mind was ended when he heard the
lieutenant&rsquo;s voice ordering the men to charge.</p>
<p>While the two bodies of Indians worked such
fearful havoc among the patrols, a third and stronger
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_21' name='page_21'></a>21</span>
party&mdash;fifty in number, and many of them mounted&mdash;had
worked round to the open and were attacking
the remainder of the company with tomahawks and
spears. The horses, many of them already liberated
by the savages, were plunging and screaming. Lowry,
who had leapt on to the back of one of them, was
cutting right and left with his sword at the mounted
Indians, while his men, though they fought furiously,
were retreating rather than charging, for these Cherokee
redskins, unlike the timid, treacherous bullies of the
southern and western tribes, knew no such thing as
fear; moreover, in addition to their unquestioned
bravery, they often displayed, in their warfare, an
amount of forethought and method that would not
have discredited a white regiment.</p>
<p>Naturally, Munson&rsquo;s first care was to get rid of his
burden; and he resolutely turned his back on the
fighting and made for the little tent that had been
hastily rigged up for the two officers when the company
halted. Depositing the wounded man here, he snatched
up a rifle and hurried breathlessly back to take part
in the fray, which was but a small part, for, all in a
moment, a spear, thrown with terrific force, struck
him in the shoulder and he dropped to the ground,
striking his head on a boulder so violently that he lost
consciousness.</p>
<p>When he recovered himself, some Indians were
bending over him, and one of them asked him, by
signs, if he could stand. He contrived to stagger to
his feet; then, finding that his water-flask was still
at his belt, took a long drink from it, for his lips and
throat seemed as dry as the back of his hand.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_22' name='page_22'></a>22</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Well done, sergeant; bravo!&rdquo; said someone behind
him; and other voices echoed the sentiment. He
turned his head dazedly, and gave a start of astonishment.
Under a tree near him stood ten men of his
company, some of them with heads or limbs roughly
bandaged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s up? he asked. What&rsquo;s happened,
anyhow?&rdquo;</p>
<p>One of the Indians here took him by the arm, led
him over to the tree, and signified that he must take
his stand with the rest; and now he could see that
those of his comrades who were not wounded had
their hands bound, and that every man had a lasso-like
thong tied about his waist, the other end of which
at present trailed loosely on the ground.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re all on us prisoners; that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s happened,&rdquo;
said a corporal by whose side he had been placed.
&ldquo;I thought <em>you</em> was done for; &rsquo;pon my word I did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s all the rest?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dead, or else cut their lucky. Lowry, he&rsquo;s gone
out, poor feller.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How about Left&rsquo;nant Boyd?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guess he got clear after all. I seen two o&rsquo; the boys
gettin&rsquo; him on to a saddle-horse. There&rsquo;s one thing,
them as got away on horseback&rsquo;ll soon take the news
to Wayne, so if these varmints don&rsquo;t tomahawk us or
set light to us, I surmise he&rsquo;ll soon be along to rescue
us.... What&rsquo;s their game now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Several mounted redskins were coming over to the
prisoners, and after a few words with those who had
been taking charge of them, made a sign to the Yankees
that they must be prepared to march. The loose ends
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_23' name='page_23'></a>23</span>
of the thongs that bound them were handed up to one
or other of the horsemen, and they were soon being
dragged forward at a brisk walking pace. Munson
indicated that he could not walk far till his wound had
received attention, whereupon, instead of treating him
like the rest, the Indians lifted him on to a spare
horse, fastened his ankles under the animal&rsquo;s belly,
and one of the mounted Cherokees, seizing the bridle,
rode on with his captive.</p>
<p>The procession turned at once into the thickest
part of the forest, the horses stepping along so quickly,
nevertheless, that those on foot could scarcely keep
up with them. Although there was no visible track
for them to follow, the redskins appeared to know quite
well where they were going; they conversed very
little among themselves, and Munson was riding too
far away from his comrades to be able to communicate
with them. As nearly as he could guess by the light,
it must have been after five o&rsquo;clock, and he had eaten
nothing since midday. He signed to his companion
that he was hungry, but the Indian merely shook his
head. In about an hour from the time of starting
the horses were stopped, a short conversation ensued
among the riders, and then, to the sergeant&rsquo;s dismay,
all moved on again, every one of the prisoners being
taken in a different direction.</p>
<p>Munson&rsquo;s captor, who was now joined by two other
savages, turned in the direction of the lake shore,
and, quickening their pace to a canter, they rode a
good twelve miles without stopping. By dark they
arrived at an encampment where there were at least
sixty wigwams pitched. The horses were pulled up,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_24' name='page_24'></a>24</span>
the prisoner&rsquo;s feet were freed, and he was ordered to
dismount. He again made signs that he was hungry,
and this time one of the Indians pointed encouragingly
to a cooking-pot that hung over the nearest fire, and
bade him sit down on the grass.</p>
<p>Presently a squaw brought a kind of meal cake,
and, plunging a wooden fork into the pot, brought
out a bird rather larger than a pigeon, which she
laid on the cake and handed to the captive, the three
Indians helping themselves in a similar manner.
After a while, voices and the tramp of more horses
became audible, and about fifty Indians, seemingly of
the same tribe as those who had attacked the soldiers,
marched or rode into the camp. Many of these must
have been away on a hunting expedition, for they had
with them a good supply of birds, deer, hares, and
foxes.</p>
<p>Feeling considerably stronger and more hopeful
after his meal, the American cast his eyes round in
search of a way of escape. He was unbound, and
might possibly succeed in crawling, inch by inch,
down to the water-side; yet, with his shoulder in its
present condition, he could neither swim nor&mdash;supposing
he should have the luck to find a canoe&mdash;work
a paddle; reason, moreover, suggested that a
semi-permanent camp such as this appeared to be,
would assuredly be far enough away from any white
station or boat-route.</p>
<p>While he was still revolving plans, two redskins
crossed over to him, made him stand, seized his arms
and bound them securely, though not unmercifully,
behind his back, and motioned to him to follow them.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_25' name='page_25'></a>25</span>
They conducted him towards the largest of the wigwams,
outside which sat the chief of the tribe, solemnly
smoking. After an interval of dead silence, that
personage gave a little shout, and all the men in the
camp collected round about the prisoner. A lengthy
harangue followed, addressed partly to Munson, partly
to the bystanders; and, at the close of this, one of the
Indians drew a knife and whetted it on his moccasin.</p>
<p>Young Munson pulled himself together and endeavoured
to take courage from the fact that, if death
had now come, it had come while he was doing his
duty; a man of his calling must expect to meet it any
day of the week; indeed, how many of his old comrades-in-arms
had met it within the last few hours?
At least the savages should see that he could die like
a man, without making a fuss.</p>
<p>The Indians nearest to him took him by the shoulders
and forced him into a sitting posture, and the man
with the knife walked slowly up to him and stood
grinning over him. Then a horrible thought came to
him; they were going to give him a punishment
almost worse than death&mdash;to scalp him, in fact&mdash;an
indignity which only a man who had lived all his
life in the neighbourhood of Indians could fully
appreciate. He wriggled himself free and, springing
up again, kicked out fiercely at his tormentors. For
this they seemed to care little; the man&rsquo;s hands were
tied and he was at their mercy. He was forced down
again and held motionless; then, while one man
gripped him by the back of his neck so that he could
not possibly move his head, the operator with the knife
entered upon his task.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_26' name='page_26'></a>26</span></div>
<p>But he whom Munson had regarded as the public executioner
was but the barber to the tribe; the formidable-looking
knife had no more terrible work to perform
than that of shaving the unfortunate man&rsquo;s head,
and this in token that henceforth he was the chief&rsquo;s
bond-slave.</p>
<p>So much relieved that he laughed loudly at himself
for his idle fears, the sergeant was then liberated,
and taken to a wigwam where he found a fellow-slave,
a Crow Indian, who had been captured some few weeks
earlier; and both occupied the tent that night, by
no means cheered by the fact that an armed redskin
stood at the entrance all night long.</p>
<p>Apart from his anxiety to let his friends know of his
whereabouts, the young man was not unhappy among
the Cherokees. For the first month or two of his captivity
a very close watch was kept upon him, and, even
later, it was at all times difficult for him to be away
from observation for many consecutive minutes; but
gradually he was given more liberty, was allowed to
go fishing and hunting within certain limits, and was
not again subjected to the disgrace of having his head
shaved. His principal duties were to carry water
from the lake, collect firewood, tend the fires, and do
such other menial work as the squaws were not strong
enough for, and as the men were too proud to do.
Having no one to converse with in his own language,
he rapidly picked up theirs, more rapidly indeed than
they realised, for they would often talk of their war
plans in his presence as though he would not understand
their talk. From the more approachable of the
Cherokees he occasionally learned news of the outside
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_27' name='page_27'></a>27</span>
world; heard that General Wayne was still fighting
against their people, and that &ldquo;they themselves didn&rsquo;t
care a button for him.&rdquo; He never saw, among them,
any of the horrible scenes of blood and torture which
other captives among Indians have described; they
were ignorant and superstitious, but neither lazy
nor drunken nor particularly cruel. Sometimes the
&ldquo;war-arrow&rdquo; was brought into the camp by some
fleet messenger, and then the majority of the braves
would gallop away or set off in their canoes, and,
after an absence of hours or days, would return&mdash;often
laden with spoil taken from the Sioux or the
whites, and sometimes leaving some of their number
behind.</p>
<p>We may be sure that, all this while, Munson had
worked out a good many schemes for effecting his
escape; but, like a wise man, he knew that one unsuccessful
attempt would infallibly result in prolonging
his captivity and rendering it more severe, if not
actually in his death. When he started, there must
be no half-measures; all hindrances and difficulties
must be foreseen and allowed for. He practised
assiduously the art of following a trail, whether by
land or water; already he had become very handy
with a bow and arrow, for he was never allowed firearms;
he did his best to become an expert canoeman,
and lost no opportunity, in fact, of learning to outwit
the enemy with their own weapons, all the while
telling himself that, sooner or later, the golden opportunity
must come.</p>
<p>It did come, but not till he had been in the Cherokee
camp for nearly eight months. One morning, in the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_28' name='page_28'></a>28</span>
summer of 1794, three Indians whom he had never
seen before and who, he learned, were of the Huron
tribe, rode into the camp and held a short parley with
the chief. Very soon the place was in an uproar,
and Munson was easily able to find out the news. The
Iowas had spied out this camp and that of some neighbouring
Hurons, had betrayed the secret to the Yankee
general, and he was now on his way to attack the
Hurons&rsquo; stronghold. In an hour&rsquo;s time all the men,
save three aged braves, had left the wigwams and
were on the war-path.</p>
<p>For a while the sergeant hesitated. If the soldiers
really knew how to find the camp they would force
their way to it before long, cost them what it might;
and he would be set at liberty. But the chances were
that he might be either shot down before he could
make himself known to them, or be killed by the
Indians the moment he endeavoured to do so. He
would never get a better opportunity of escaping than
this, for the weather was warm, there was no one to
stop him from going, and the canoes were all at his
service, as the braves had gone in the opposite direction
to the water.</p>
<p>He waited five days, for the old men left behind
had shown a certain amount of suspicion of him
for the first day or two. Then, with a plentiful supply
of food, arrows, and fish-spears, he stole away soon
after sundown, crept into a canoe and paddled away
from the shore. His object was to reach Buffalo if
possible, but that was over a hundred miles away,
and he could not paddle day and night without rest.
Knowing that he must husband his strength, he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_29' name='page_29'></a>29</span>
confined himself to an easy rate of about three miles
an hour; and even then, by the time he had gone
thirty miles, he could hardly keep his eyes open.</p>
<p>He had recourse to the good old specific of cold
water, took a header into the lake and, after a short
swim, returned to his post, ate a cold but hearty
breakfast, and began again, all the while keeping his
eyes open for any white men&rsquo;s boat that might come
along. But the hours went by and he saw nothing,
and the desire for sleep became as pressing&mdash;and just
now as much to be dreaded&mdash;as though he had been lost
in a snow-drift. He took a second dip and, clambering
back into the canoe, began paddling again, though his
muscles were now so stiff that he could scarcely move
his arms.</p>
<p>He was nodding over his now almost useless labour
when a light splash, like the bob of a fish, made him
look round him. The splash had been caused by an
arrow. Behind him, two canoes, each with three
Indians in it, were coming along at a speed that he
could not have beaten even had he been perfectly
fresh. For just one second there was the hope
that the redskins might be of some tribe hostile to
the Cherokees, who would be willing to help him in
return for promises of money, which he could easily
obtain from some charitable person at Buffalo. But
he knew the build, the costume, the very method of
using the paddles, too well; these men were Cherokees.
He turned round to pick up his bow, and, in so doing,
looked over the side. Floating within a yard or two
of him was an arrow, lying perfectly horizontal!
He stared at it open-mouthed; an arrow, if the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_30' name='page_30'></a>30</span>
weight of its head did not sink it entirely, must float
perpendicularly, showing but very little of its length.</p>
<p>But this particular arrow <em>had</em> no head; a token
that it had not been shot in any unfriendly spirit.
He looked back at his pursuers again; one of them
was waving his hand, and, as his canoe came almost
within touching distance, shouted:</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have some fish; will you give us bread in
exchange for some? We have no bread, and very little
tobacco.&rdquo; The words sounded very much like an
excerpt from Somebody or Other&rsquo;s &ldquo;French Exercises,&rdquo;
not the less so in that they were uttered in French-Canadian&mdash;a
language which Munson understood perfectly
well. He could almost have cried with relief.</p>
<p>The Cherokees were Ontario fishermen; Christians,
and the sons of Christians, and no more likely to interfere
with the soldier than if they had been his fellow-countrymen.
On finding that he spoke not only
French but their own Iroquoian as well, they became
exceedingly friendly; but Munson (perhaps he did
them grave injustice) had become far too cautious
to tell them the circumstances under which he had
learned their language. He confined himself to the
statement that he wished to reach Buffalo, and would
reward them amply if they would put him ashore
there; he had been robbed of his money, he said&mdash;which
was perfectly true&mdash;but could easily get some
in the town; he was too tired to use his paddles;
would they take him there?</p>
<p>The next thing he knew was that the Indians were
waking him at the quay outside Buffalo; he had fallen
asleep even while trying to strike a bargain with them,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_31' name='page_31'></a>31</span>
and now they refused to take any other payment
than the tobacco and provisions with which he had
stored his boat; and, bidding him good-bye, they
landed him and paddled away again.</p>
<p>He went to the nearest military depôt and reported
himself, and of course had no difficulty in obtaining the
means to reach his home.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>
<h3>THE INVASION OF CORRIENTES</h3>
</div>
<p>The South American Indian, as a soldier, is a being
about whom we English know very little. Of
course we know that, centuries ago, he was a
force to be reckoned with locally; we know that when
his civilisation was stamped out of him he became a
mere savage, ignorant, dirty, brutal and crafty; but
it is something of a surprise to us to learn that, during
the first quarter of the nineteenth century, he occasionally
shook off much of his savagery, and showed
himself the equal of the white soldier in discipline,
generalship, staying-power and chivalry. A case in
point is that of Andresito Artegas, one of the most
striking figures in modern South American history.</p>
<p>Andresito, who belonged to the Guaycuru branch
of the great Guaranian tribe, was the adopted son of the
celebrated insurgent leader, Artegas, who seems to
have given him some education and to have developed
in him the great natural foresight and controlling
power which he was to exhibit later in the war between
the Guaranians and the Portuguese of Argentina.</p>
<p>This petty war, which lasted roughly from 1818 to
1820, was largely a &ldquo;coming to a head&rdquo; of the constant
bickerings, forays, and persecutions which, for years,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_33' name='page_33'></a>33</span>
had been interchanged between the white man and
the red; and though, in the end, the Indians were
badly beaten and the tribe almost annihilated, in the
early and middle stages of the contest there seemed
every likelihood of the Portuguese being driven out of
La Plata. In 1819, emboldened by a train of minor
successes, Andresito, with a force of seven hundred
Guaycurus, determined to seize the city of Corrientes.</p>
<p>Next to Buenos Ayres, this was the wealthiest and
most important of the Argentine towns, and much of
the commerce was in the hands of British merchants,
such as the well-known brothers Robertson, and their
friend and sometime patron Thomas Postlethwaite.
To men like this the news of Andresito&rsquo;s advance was
alarming enough, for it would probably mean financial
ruin, if nothing worse; but to the more excitable
Portuguese residents it was absolute paralysis. People
went stark mad with panic; the seven hundred Indians
became seven, and even seventy, thousand. Tales
went from mouth to mouth of massacres unspeakable
in every village and town on Andresito&rsquo;s line of march,
and it was said that the Paraguay boundary and the
Parana River&mdash;the only means of safety hitherto open
to fugitives&mdash;were already in Indian hands.</p>
<p>Mr. Postlethwaite, disappointed in the hopes of
being able to send his two daughters down the river to
Buenos Ayres, resolved to take matters into his own
hands as far as possible, and saw that all the Europeans
were armed and ready to band together in self-defence.
But before anything in the way of concerted effort
could be agreed upon, rumour became fact; Andresito
and his Indian cavalry were within half a mile of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_34' name='page_34'></a>34</span>
city. Two Portuguese men dropped dead in the street
with fright; Francisco Bedoya, commandant of the
colonial troops, lost his head altogether; collected all
the money and plate he could lay his hands on and
buried it in the garden, then began to run about the
streets like a rat in a trap.</p>
<p>As a last resource, Mr. Postlethwaite sent one of his
servants to Andresito with a letter, warning him that
our Government might mete out a terrible punishment
if British life and property were not respected; and,
to his great relief, the man soon came riding back
with a courteous message from the young chief, to the
effect that no violence was intended to anyone, least of
all to British subjects.</p>
<p>The Englishman was imparting this message to his
friends when the steady trot of a large body of horse
was heard, and everyone either rushed to hiding-places
or swarmed into the streets. Postlethwaite
and his daughters reached the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Plaza</i> in time to see the
Indian soldiers take possession of it. Nothing could
less resemble a horde of uncivilised invaders than
these seven hundred men. Headed by the handsome
young Andresito and his Spanish-Peruvian secretary,
Mexias, the Guaycurus halted and dismounted at the
sound of the bugle, and it could be seen that they
were a set of well-trained fellows, armed like a European
cavalry troop, dressed like civilised people, and
apparently no more ready for outrage than if they
had been loyalist soldiers come to rescue the town.</p>
<p>The rear of the procession was certainly remarkable,
being composed of four hundred boys of from six to
fourteen years, half of them the children of white
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_35' name='page_35'></a>35</span>
people, round whom thronged a mixed group of
farmers and their wives, screaming, threatening, and
entreating. The Indian boys were liberated slaves,
and it appeared that wherever Andresito had found a
native child in captivity, he had freed him and taken a
white boy prisoner. It is interesting to know that, not
many days later, the Indian chief gathered together the
distressed parents who had been able to keep up with
or to follow his march, and handed the white children
over to them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have given you a lesson, he said. In future,
try to remember that Indian parents have hearts as
well as you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Andresito&rsquo;s first act on arriving at the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Plaza</i> was
certainly not that of a bloodthirsty tyrant; for,
marshalling his men on foot, he led them straight
into the cathedral to hear Mass, and as soon as the
service was ended, began to converse amicably with
the principal inhabitants of the town. The cowardly
commandant, Bedoya, had found a place of concealment;
perhaps his conscience pricked him, for only a
few weeks before he had instigated the massacre of an
entire Indian village. At any rate, he would not face the
Guaycurus, and in imitation of their valiant leader, the
whole garrison deserted their barracks, leaving them
at the new-comers&rsquo; disposal.</p>
<p>In Mr. Postlethwaite, Andresito speedily recognised
a far-seeing, wise, and courageous old man, whose
advice would be worth listening to; and after a few
days, the Englishman&rsquo;s influence over him became so
great that, during the young leader&rsquo;s occasional outbursts
of ungovernable temper or drunkenness, his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_36' name='page_36'></a>36</span>
followers would invariably send for the tactful merchant
and beg him to manage their chief for them.</p>
<p>No doubt this peaceful state of things might have
lasted indefinitely but for two unpleasant factors;
the first of which was the spite and jealousy of Mexias,
the Indian chief&rsquo;s secretary&mdash;a vulgar toady and
adventurer who could not be loyal to white man or
red, and who, alarmed at the willingness with which
Andresito listened to Postlethwaite&rsquo;s counsels, lost
no opportunity of poisoning his mind against the
honest merchant.</p>
<p>The second probable cause of trouble was the ill-bred
conduct of the Spanish and Portuguese residents
towards the Indian chiefs. We all know, either from
history or experience, that it is dangerous and unwise
to ignore the natural barrier that exists between the
white and the coloured races; but that is no reason
why a man should be gratuitously insulted because
he is an Indian; and when Andresito found himself
regarded socially with contempt and ridicule by people
who, a fortnight earlier, would have knelt and grovelled
to him for their lives, he was not unnaturally out of
temper.</p>
<p>From these two causes, relations became more and
more strained, and one morning a file of soldiers
appeared at Postlethwaite&rsquo;s house, arrested him on a
variety of stupid and trumped-up charges, and
lodged him in the common prison among criminals
of the lowest type. His elder daughter at once went to
Andresito&rsquo;s hotel, but could not obtain an interview
with him till the next day. Then the chief happened
to be in a good humour, and after some little argument,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_37' name='page_37'></a>37</span>
admitted that the arrest was due to Mexias&rsquo; having told
him that her father meditated escaping to Buenos
Ayres to warn the Portuguese; and on the girl&rsquo;s
indignantly denying this, the prisoner was set at
liberty.</p>
<p>As a peace-offering for this affront to the Europeans,
Andresito gave a great dinner-party to the chief
residents, which was to be followed by a display of
picturesque Indian dances. Very few of the Spaniards
or Portuguese accepted the invitation, and those
who did were particularly offensive in their comments
on the dancing. Andresito left the hall in a towering
rage.</p>
<p>The following morning the Postlethwaite household
was again disturbed by a visit from Indian soldiers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What now?&rdquo; asked the merchant, losing patience.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All those who received invitations to the General&rsquo;s
entertainment last night are to come and report themselves;
the gentlemen at the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Plaza</i> and the ladies
at the barracks,&rdquo; said a soldier civilly.</p>
<p>The two English girls followed their conductors
to the barracks, and there found all the best-known
white women of Corrientes guarded by a troop of
soldiers. Andresito soon made his appearance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ladies, he said, I understand that you disapprove
of Indian dances; therefore I have invited you
here to teach us better. When each lady has condescended
to dance with an Indian soldier she will be
set at liberty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Postlethwaite and her sister had the good
sense to regard the affair as one of humour rather
than of humiliation, and not stopping to point out
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_38' name='page_38'></a>38</span>
that they were being punished for the misdeeds of
others, they readily yielded to the chief&rsquo;s whim,
and were the first to be dismissed. They hurried at
once to the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Plaza</i>, and here a very unlooked-for sight
awaited them.</p>
<p>Guarded by a hundred soldiers under Mexias, all the
well-to-do men of the town were at work on their hands
and knees, weeding the square, rooting out, with fingers
or penknives, the tufts of shabby grass that grew
plentifully between the cobble-stones! The heat was
so suffocating that their father and other elderly men
were well-nigh fainting; but there all were obliged
to remain till the task was finished, shortly before
sundown.</p>
<p>This indignity so enraged Postlethwaite that he was
tempted to persuade the white men to combine against
their persecutors and rid the town of them, but was
deterred by the irresolution and petty jealousies of the
Corrientes men, and by the thought of the terrible
amount of bloodshed for which he would be making
himself responsible. Abandoning that idea, he fell
back on plans for escape. This would be difficult, if not
impossible, for Indians were said to be in possession
of the country all round, and flight by water was
out of the question, because all the boats had been
destroyed or sent adrift, and the larger craft from
Buenos Ayres seldom came farther north than Goya.</p>
<p>By way of lulling any suspicions on Andresito&rsquo;s
part as to his schemes, he invited him and his staff to
dinner one evening. The Indians conducted themselves
with great dignity and politeness, and were
very loud in their praise of British fare&mdash;particularly
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_39' name='page_39'></a>39</span>
of the &ldquo;plom puddin Ingles&rdquo; with which the host
regaled them. Andresito&rsquo;s bearing towards his young
hostesses was gallantry itself; he even styled them
his <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">paysanitas</i> or countrywomen, as well as <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Indias
rubias</i> (fair Indians.)</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what makes you think we are your compatriots,
Señor?&rdquo; asked the younger girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, Señorita,&rdquo; said Andresito, &ldquo;I fear you have
not studied the history of England as I have done.
Did you not know that <em>all</em> the people in your country
were Indians till the Spanish king, Julius C&aelig;sar,
conquered it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The dinner passed off very brightly and merrily,
and at last the English merchant proposed the health
of the Indian chief. This was drunk heartily; but
Mexias, who had much of the mischief-maker and still
more of the cad in him, having emptied his glass,
broke it and threw the pieces over his shoulder, calling
on the Indians to do the same. Now this was not at
all an uncommon Spanish custom; but Miss Postlethwaite
had strong objections to seeing every glass
in the house broken, at a time when communication
with the capital was cut off, and even the simplest
household necessaries difficult to procure. She whispered
a hint to Andresito, at which the hot-headed
fellow sprang up, drew his sword, and vowed that he
would kill the next man who broke a glass.</p>
<p>In revenge for this snub, the Peruvian asked the
Postlethwaite ladies and others to a dinner; and
when all had partaken of and commended the soup
and entrées, he took occasion to inform his guests
with great insolence that the substance of all the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_40' name='page_40'></a>40</span>
savouries was horse-beef. This elegant practical joke
was his last. The following evening he was met by
the brother of one of the Spanish ladies, who promptly
avenged the insult in a manner not unusual among
people of Latin blood&mdash;by plunging a knife into his
back.</p>
<p>This incident was the beginning of general anarchy.
Indians and Argentines alike took the law into their
own hands, the latter emboldened by rumours that
white armies were marching on the city, the former
restless and demoralised through their leader&rsquo;s inability
to press on to further conquests till he was
reinforced by the troops of Indians, half-castes, or
insurgent whites for which he was waiting. To Mr.
Postlethwaite there now seemed no more risk in flight
than in remaining in the city; so, secreting his portable
wealth, and sending his daughters forward with horses
and two armed menservants as occasion offered, he
managed to join them at nightfall near the river and
well beyond the town.</p>
<p>They made excellent pace, and soon after daybreak
had reached the strip of desolate, hilly country that
runs along the west bank of the Parana. Then Postlethwaite
called a halt, and had decided that they would
rest themselves and their horses for a few hours,
when Juan, his Spanish cook, pointed back to some
moving objects at the foot of the long hill whose
summit they had just reached&mdash;Indians, from the way
they sat their horses, though the distance was too
great for the watchers to distinguish whether they
were the half-naked savages of the country or the
better-dressed, better-armed cavalry of Andresito.</p>

<span class='smcap'>A Narrow Escape</span><br />
<br />
When Corrientes was seized by Andresito and his Indians Mr. Postlethwaite and his daughters succeeded in escaping to the banks of the Parana. A pursuing body of Indians almost captured them, but the boat&rsquo;s crew of a ship which happened to be lying in the river kept them at bay with oars and boat-stretchers.<br />
</p>
</div>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_41' name='page_41'></a>41</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;In either case we must not risk falling into their
hands,&rdquo; said Postlethwaite. &ldquo;Up with you all
again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the horses are so beaten,&rdquo; urged his elder
daughter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not more so than theirs, probably,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;And they have a good mile or more of hill to climb.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The jaded beasts were hastily mounted again, and,
always keeping the river in sight, the party made
what speed they could towards the nearest white
station or landing-stage. The hill which their pursuers
had yet to climb would double the value of the start
they had of them, to be sure; but there would be no
means of hiding from them when they again reached
the high level, and unless the Indians&rsquo; horses were
extraordinarily fatigued, it was to be feared that
they would soon make up for lost time.</p>
<p>For the next half-hour there was no sign of redskins.
Then one head, then another, straggled into view,
but still so far distant that the fugitives could not see
whether they were moving or stationary. Their
own horses were on their last legs, so much so that it
was becoming sheer brutality to urge them on. The two
girls dismounted and turned their poor beasts loose
and the servants followed their example&mdash;as did also
Postlethwaite himself when, on looking back once
more, he could see at least ten figures&mdash;moving now,
beyond all doubt&mdash;not much more than a mile behind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We shall have to run for it,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A ship, Señor; a ship!&rdquo; cried one of the men
hysterically, pointing ahead; and sure enough there
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_42' name='page_42'></a>42</span>
were the two naked topmasts of a brig, a mile or more
farther down the river.</p>
<p>No one else remarked on the sight; no one had
breath to spare for anything but running.</p>
<p>Five minutes went by, and they seemed no nearer.
The Englishman glanced behind him; the Indians
had not appreciably lessened the distance between
them. Another five minutes, and then voices were
becoming distinctly audible, though whether those of
seamen or pursuers it was difficult to say. Postlethwaite
began to stumble.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m&mdash;done for,&rdquo; he panted. &ldquo;You must go on&mdash;and
send help back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no, give me your hand,&rdquo; cried his elder
daughter. &ldquo;Look; look behind you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He obeyed. The two foremost Indians had abandoned
their horses and come within gunshot; and one
was coolly taking aim at them with his musket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only another minute or two,&rdquo; said the girl
soothingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are you going? Where are you going?&rdquo;
cried a voice in Spanish.</p>
<p>They were running exactly parallel to the river,
but about thirty yards from the water-edge. Looking
to their left they saw for the first time that one of
the brig&rsquo;s boats had drawn up as close as possible to
the bank and that her coxswain was beckoning to
them.</p>
<p>They needed no further warning, but made a dash
for the boat. As they did so a bullet whistled past
their ears, and the younger girl sank down on the dry
grass.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_43' name='page_43'></a>43</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;She is wounded; she is killed,&rdquo; shouted Postlethwaite.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Señor; only faint and frightened,&rdquo; panted
the stalwart cook, and, hastily picking his young
mistress up in his arms, he caught up the others, who
were dragged on board as a second bullet flew over
their heads. Juan handed in his burden and was about
to vault over the gunwale, when his foot slipped on the
mud and he fell sideways into the water.</p>
<p>With drawn swords the two Indians&mdash;emissaries of
Andresito&mdash;made a dash at him, but were kept aloof
by oars and boat-stretchers; and as one of them
drew a pistol, Juan&rsquo;s fellow-servant did likewise and
sent a bullet through his arm, just as the plucky
cook was dragged into safety and the boat pushed into
the stream.</p>
<p>Not long afterwards a strong Portuguese force drove
the Guaycurus out of Corrientes and took Andresito
prisoner. He was conveyed to the coast and eventually
liberated; but he died not long after, and with him the
hopes of independence which the Guaranian Indians
had been cherishing.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>
<h3>A CAPTIVE AMONG ARGENTINE INDIANS</h3>
</div>
<p>Till the beginning of the nineteenth century, the
Guaranian Indians (with the Abipons and other
sub-tribes) were in possession of a great part
of Southern Brazil, Paraguay, and Eastern Argentina.
They were one of the strongest of the Indian peoples,
unusually tall and athletic, and, so long as they had
reliable leaders, well able to hold their own against
the Portuguese. But owing to internal dissensions,
intermarriages with Europeans, and more especially
to the crushing defeat by the colonists, in 1820, of their
great chief Andresito Artegas, they had become, by the
middle of the century, a negligible quantity.</p>
<p>Much of their trouble with the Portuguese was of
their own seeking; for, not content with beating off
their attacks, they were perpetually making unprovoked
raids upon peaceful farmsteads, carrying off
not only cattle, but European boys and girls, of whom
they not infrequently made slaves. A typical instance
of this sort of thing came under the notice of Mr. Peter
Campbell, better known as Don Pedro, <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Commandante
de Marinos</i>, or Admiral of the Fleet, who from 1819
onwards was in the employ of the Argentine Government.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_45' name='page_45'></a>45</span></div>
<p>Two Portuguese girls, with their little brother, were
returning on horseback to their father&rsquo;s farm near
Cordoba, when a series of frantic yells behind them
warned them that savages were in pursuit. A single
glance back was sufficient to show how futile all
attempts at flight would probably be; the redskins
were well mounted and used to riding at breakneck
pace, while the girls&rsquo; horses, not too spirited at the
best of times, were jaded with a long, hot journey.</p>
<p>The cries&mdash;rendered more savage and blood-curdling
by the Indian practice of simultaneously clapping the
lips with the palm of the hand&mdash;grew louder and
more bewildering. The boy lost control of his horse&mdash;the
youngest and fastest of the three&mdash;and was soon
well ahead of his sisters, the younger of whom, Ascencion
by name, had the presence of mind to scream to
him to ride straight on to Cordoba, if possible, and
warn the military authorities there. The words were
hardly out of her mouth when a shriek came from her
sister, who was a dozen yards behind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am taken. Do not desert me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ascencion turned her head, only to see the chief
himself, a splendid-looking elderly man, riding straight
for her own bridle.</p>
<p>In another minute both girls were prisoners. Each
was dragged from her saddle and lifted to that of her
captor; their two horses were handed to some young
Indians who rode in the rear, and then they found
themselves being whirled away in the direction of the
Parana River, which lay some hundred and seventy
miles distant. The cavalcade made no halt till long
after dark, when it arrived at a <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">tolderia</i> or native
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_46' name='page_46'></a>46</span>
encampment. Here the girls were handed over to the
womenfolk, who, after robbing them of all their
finery, took them to separate tents and told them
what would be their future duties.</p>
<p>Worn out with grief and excitement, Ascencion
threw herself on the ground in her wigwam (<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">toldos</i>)
and, refusing food, sobbed herself to sleep. When
she awoke, it was day; she was alone in the tent, and
now had leisure to examine it and its contents. This
was soon done. The miserable abode was a pyramidal
hut, each side about nine feet long and consisting
merely of a few tall slender sticks, across which a rough
matting of straw, like a collection of old bottle cases,
was laid. Through the matting sufficient daylight
struggled to show that the only furniture of the
<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">toldos</i> consisted of half a dozen bows of great length,
and a few gourds, fashioned into drinking-cups.</p>
<p>She was creeping to the entry in the hope of finding
out her sister&rsquo;s whereabouts, when agitated shouts
resounded through the camp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Flee, flee! The Cordoban soldiers are coming.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Those shouts were the sweetest music she had ever
heard. Heedless of the danger she might incur, she
rushed into the open, calling loudly for her sister.</p>
<p>What followed was very like a nightmare. Redskinned,
half-naked figures flitted backwards and
forwards, screaming incoherently, in her tongue and
their own. Then all of a sudden the tents round about
seemed to rise up of themselves and collapse. A
lengthy, rumbling chorus of shouts came from a
hundred yards away, followed by a carbine volley
whose bullets knocked up the dust all round her, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_47' name='page_47'></a>47</span>
one of which laid a young Indian dead, almost within
a yard of her. Then she caught sight of her sister
being lifted into a saddle, and while she endeavoured
to attract her attention, a hand was pressed over her
own mouth and strong arms swung her on to a horse
which seemed to come from nowhere. She knew
nothing more till she found herself being borne at a
tearing speed across the plain, lashed inextricably
to the cacique&rsquo;s body.</p>
<p>She stole a glance over her shoulder. Less than half
a mile away she could see, through a cloud of dust, a
string of straggling mounted figures, half a dozen riding
ahead, and seven or eight more trying in vain to keep
up with them; and from the flash of the sun-rays on
their scabbards and metal horse-furniture, she knew
them to be white men. But would they overtake her
captors? The distance increased, then lessened
considerably, then began slowly to increase again.
She heard a few shots fired by the pursuers, but these
took no effect. The space between them grew greater
than ever, for even while the Cordobans&rsquo; horses
slackened their speed and flagged, those of the Indians
seemed only to gain fresh strength; and at last she
looked away, again losing all heart. For the soldiers
had come to a dead stop, and in a few minutes she
would be carried out of all sight of them. A howl
of triumph and derision rose from the Abipons;
nevertheless, they did not draw bridle till they came
in sight of another <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">tolderia</i>, whose occupants would
form such a reinforcement as would enable them to
defy any but a very strong company of white men.</p>
<p>Ascencion had eaten nothing for twenty-four hours
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_48' name='page_48'></a>48</span>
and had held no communication with her sister since
their separation. She was now handed over to the care
of a motherly old body who was a relative of the cacique,
and presumably a person of some importance in the
tribe. Not only did she at once supply the girl with
food and drink, but she promised to make interest
for her sister to be placed with her.</p>
<p>This promise was fulfilled, and for the next week or
two the girls shared the old woman&rsquo;s hut together at
night, being kept by day in attendance on the cacique&rsquo;s
wife, who, if she made them work hard at cooking,
corn-grinding, and rough weaving, was at least not
unkind to them. But this is not to say that these
Indians were not cruel by nature and habit. One day
after a foraging party had returned, the cacique
approached the two prisoners, and addressing them in
Portuguese, said roughly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come with me. Come and see what is in store for
any of your friends who attempt to rescue you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They followed him tremblingly to the centre of the
camp, and there found a young Spaniard, bound hand
and foot to pegs that were driven into the ground.
He had been caught wandering in the forest, and,
being unarmed, was an easy capture.</p>
<p>At a word from the chief, a dozen men stepped back
from the prostrate lad, and drawing their bows, each
sent an arrow straight at him. Every arrow but one
transfixed the body; that one was ceremoniously
burnt and its ashes buried; it was in disgrace for
having missed its mark.</p>
<p>This murder was the only exhibition of cruelty
which Ascencion witnessed at that camp, though
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_49' name='page_49'></a>49</span>
almost every day the cacique threatened her and
her sister with death if they made any attempt to
escape. As far as they could gather, they were to be
kept till the next general meeting of the tribe, and
then sold or bartered as wives to the two highest bidders.</p>
<p>When they had been in captivity a little over a
fortnight some young men of the tribe rode hastily
into the camp one evening and called excitedly for
the cacique. They had, said they, been pursued by a
strong party of Macabi Indians (one of the Peruvian
sub-tribes) who had never altogether lost sight of them,
and were even now making a descent on the camp.</p>
<p>Instantly the whole tribe turned out, with bows,
spears, hatchets, and some few even with muskets.
The alarm was no false one. The Macabis, about
eighty in number, badly mounted, but far better armed
than were the Abipons, were in sight, and would soon
endeavour to surround the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">tolderia</i>, the inhabitants of
which, so far from showing any sign of unreadiness to
do battle, or anxiety as to the issue thereof, were
quickly and joyously disposing themselves to the best
advantage. Indeed, they were the first to open fire;
but the harmless volley from the half-dozen ramshackle
old muskets was answered by a deadly shower
of well-aimed bullets from at least forty guns.</p>
<p>The two slave girls, crouching with some other
women in one of the huts, could catch glimpses of the
fight through the chinks in the matting. To an
outsider it might seem that Ascencion would care
little as to the result of the conflict, but the Peruvians
were a fierce tribe, far more uncivilised than their
enemies&mdash;who were, for the most part, Christians&mdash;and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_50' name='page_50'></a>50</span>
to fall into their hands would probably involve
far worse treatment than she had undergone at the
hands of her original captors.</p>
<p>Presently, as the darkness began to fall, she saw a
score of the young men separate themselves from the
rest of the defenders, and begin to untether some of
the horses. Then one of them hastened into her
tent and bade her and those with her hurry out
to the horses. The Macabis were steadily gaining the
upper hand, and all the women were to be escorted by
as many of the tribe as could be spared, towards a
small and semi-permanent camp on the river, between
Chamorra and Goya. No time was lost in obeying,
and Ascencion had already been lifted up behind the
cacique&rsquo;s wife, when her sister, who was waiting to be
mounted on the next horse, threw up her arms and
fell without a cry. One of the enemy&rsquo;s bullets had
pierced her breast and the poor girl lay dead.</p>
<p>From that time Ascencion knew little or nothing
of what happened; she had an indistinct recollection
of an all-night ride, then of resting, once in green woods,
and once on a burning, sandy plain; then of a second
long march in the dark; but that was all. For she
was in a fever which did not leave her till some days
after their arrival at the river <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">tolderia</i>; and, when next
she left her hut, the first thing she saw was the remainder
of the tribe returning from the long battle.
They had been beaten, but nevertheless had inflicted
such a blow on the victors as crippled all attempts at
pursuit of them.</p>
<p>Then began again the same wearisome life as before,
only more intolerable now that Ascencion had lost her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_51' name='page_51'></a>51</span>
sister. But one afternoon, when most of the men were
away hunting, the cacique came up to her as she was
preparing for her daily task of fetching water from the
river, and showing his knife threateningly, observed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is a boat&rsquo;s crew of white men making for
the shore. Stay here till they are gone. If you speak
to one of them you shall die.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The caution seemed needless enough, for by this time
the poor girl had become so cowed and destitute of
hope, that she had little heart to attempt escape.
Moreover, it was quite possible that men of her own
race might be no more desirable neighbours than the
Indians. And so she sat down where she was, under a
tree, feeling but little interest in the coming of the
sailors. Looking listlessly towards the row of trees
that hid the river from her view, she presently caught
sight of the cacique ushering two white men towards
his <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">toldos</i>, and evidently bearing himself with great
obsequiousness towards them. The taller of the two
entered, but the other began idly to walk about the
camp, exchanging cheery words with the women at
work there. Very soon he was standing by Ascencion&rsquo;s
side. She was hesitating whether to answer a civil
greeting of his, when he said quickly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you are not an Indian girl, surely?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then she forgot all caution and all indifference to her
condition. She had heard her own language spoken
by one of her own people!</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; I am Portuguese. I am a prisoner,&rdquo; she
whispered eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not escape then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alas; they would kill me. No one will help me.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_52' name='page_52'></a>52</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll find someone who will,&rdquo; said the young man,
who wore a naval commander&rsquo;s uniform; and he ran
to the cacique&rsquo;s tent, Ascencion following him more
slowly. In another minute both strangers reappeared,
talking earnestly in a language which the girl could only
suppose to be English, as the second sailor was very
tall and of fair complexion. When they had almost
reached her, the Portuguese officer suddenly touched
his cap and set off running full speed back towards
the river. The other beckoning to her, and addressing
her gently in tolerable Portuguese, said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it true that you are a prisoner, my poor lass?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl hesitated, for the cacique, who had guessed
something of the import of the white men&rsquo;s conversation,
was laying his hand on the haft of his knife. But
the Englishman noticed the action, and immediately
began to finger his sword-hilt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Speak up,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;there is nothing to be
afraid of.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, interrupted every now and then by indignant
remonstrance or denial from the chief, Ascencion told
her story.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said the sailor at length. &ldquo;Come on
board my ship; I shall take you up the river to
Corrientes, and leave you with some English ladies
till your friends can be communicated with.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not so fast, Señor,&rdquo; said the cacique, assuming
a more bullying tone. &ldquo;Of course you can take her&mdash;if
you like to pay the price I&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The officer whipped out his sword. &ldquo;This is the
only price I pay,&rdquo; he said curtly.</p>

<p class='caption'>
<span class='smcap'>A Plucky Rescue</span><br />
<br />
The Indians surrounded the officer and the shrinking Portuguese girl. The Cacique threatened him with his hatchet, but a touch of the Englishman&rsquo;s sword-point at his throat made him reconsider his designs. Another Indian made at him with a knife, only to receive such a blow across the ear with the flat of the sword as knocked him to the ground.<br />
</p>
</div>
<p>The cacique laughed contemptuously, and with a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_53' name='page_53'></a>53</span>
single shout summoned the couple of dozen men who
happened to be within hearing, and who surrounded
the Englishman and the shrinking girl in an instant,
swinging their war-hatchets, and yelling one against
the other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, stop that din, do,&rdquo; said the officer with good-humoured
impatience. &ldquo;Listen to me, my lads. I
am Commandante Don Pedro&mdash;or plain Peter
Campbell, if you like that better. I&rsquo;ve got a cutter
and twenty men a few yards away, to say nothing of
a ten-gun brig with sixty hands aboard of her, in the
stream. Now, are you going to stand clear?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brigs and cutters were meaningless to the Indians;
but what they did understand was the sudden appearance
from among the trees of Don Edwardo, the
Portuguese captain, followed by a dozen sturdy
seamen&mdash;English, Yankee, and Portuguese, armed
with muskets and cutlasses.</p>
<p>The cacique re-echoed his war-cry and threatened
Campbell with his hatchet; but a touch of the Englishman&rsquo;s
sword-point at his throat made him reconsider
his designs. Another Indian made at the &ldquo;admiral&rdquo;
with a knife&mdash;only to receive such a blow across the
ear with the flat of the sword as knocked him to the
ground. The tramp of the seamen stopped, and,
at the command, muskets were slung and cutlasses
drawn.</p>
<p>The cacique bade his men drop their arms&mdash;almost
a needless recommendation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take her,&rdquo; he said sullenly.</p>
<p>Campbell pointed to the man whom he had knocked
down. &ldquo;Take away his knife,&rdquo; he said, addressing his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_54' name='page_54'></a>54</span>
boatswain, a burly Yankee. &ldquo;Now&mdash;you have
attempted to kill an Englishman, and you shall die.&rdquo;
Don Pedro felt the edge of the knife and gave it a
final &ldquo;strop&rdquo; on his palm. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to cut his
head off, as a warning to the rest of you,&rdquo; he said, so
sternly that the Indians and even the cacique uttered
little cries of terror.</p>
<p>Ascencion began to think that Englishmen were no
more merciful than other people; for, as the Indian
crouched whimpering at Don Pedro&rsquo;s feet, he stooped
and brandished the knife with all the coolness of a
butcher. But, to her amazement, when he stood up
again, the head was still in its normal position, while,
in his left hand, Campbell held the braided pigtail of
hair, full five feet long, which had proudly adorned
the head of the would-be assassin; and he, still
doubting his good fortune in having got off so cheaply,
sprang up and made headlong for the woods.</p>
<p>This is but one of the scores of anecdotes told of the
celebrated soldier of fortune, Peter Campbell, who,
whatever may have been his faults, was never known
to show fear, to be disloyal to his employers or unjust
to the Indians; indeed, by his unfailing good nature
and sense of fairness and fun, he succeeded in adjusting
many a tribal or political grievance which in the hands
of most men, however well-meaning, would probably
have ended in bloodshed.</p>
<p>The Portuguese girl was taken up the river, and
when she returned to her parents she was accompanied
by a husband, for she married an Irish settler in
Corrientes.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>
<h3>THE IROQUOIS OF THE CANADIAN BOUNDARY</h3>
</div>
<p>The Iroquoian branch of the red race is considered
by the best authorities to be far superior,
mentally and physically, to any other. Before
British rule was definitely established in Canada,
they were a power (known as &ldquo;The Six Nations&rdquo;)
duly recognised by English and French alike; and
to-day, though less numerous than the Algonquins,
they show fewer signs of dying out than the other
families. Ontario is, and has ever been, a favourite
district of theirs, and it was while living in this province
that Dr. John Bigsby, who died in 1881, jotted down
the notes concerning them which one often sees quoted
in works dealing with the study of races.</p>
<p>Surgeon-Major Bigsby had the good fortune, as a
young man, to be appointed geologist and medical
officer to the Canadian Boundary Commission, a
post decidedly congenial to a zealous student of
ethnology, since it brought him in constant touch
with the Cherokees, who, with the Hurons, Mohawks,
etc., constitute the Iroquoian family. The inspection
of military and native hospitals, together with his

geological researches, necessitated frequent journeys
north, south, and west from Montreal; and it was on
one such journey, in the year 1822, that he met with a
string of adventures both comical and exciting.</p>
<p>From Montreal he set out in a light waggon for
Kingston, where he fell in with an acquaintance, Jules
Rocheblanc, a fur-trader who, like himself, had various
calls to make on the shores of Lake Ontario. Rocheblanc
had already arranged to travel with Father
Tabeau, the diocesan inspector of missions, and the
doctor very willingly joined their party. The mission
boat, unlike the birch canoes, was a well-built, roomy
craft paddled by eight or ten Indians&mdash;Cherokees and
Hurons&mdash;all of whom spoke Canadian-French fluently.
The weather, though cool, was far from severe, and as
all three travellers had frequent engagements ashore,
these made welcome breaks in the journey.</p>
<p>After Toronto was passed, the white stations became
scarcer, and villages inhabited by Indians more
frequent; and, at the first of these, the young army
surgeon began to fear that the treachery so often
justly imputed to the redskins was going to betray
itself.</p>
<p>Three of the Indians had asked leave to go
ashore for a day&rsquo;s hunting, and, as the meat supply
had run short, Père Tabeau was glad to let them go,
on the understanding that they were to await him that
evening at a spot below the next Indian village, at
which he was to halt for a few hours. Owing to some
minor accident, it was well on in the afternoon before
the boat came in sight of the village, which stood
at the foot of a hill, immediately on the lake shore.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_57' name='page_57'></a>57</span></div>
<p>Two or three dozen Indians could be seen on a
grassy space, engaged in their national ball-play&mdash;a
mixture of tennis, lacrosse, and Rugby football, which
will be more closely described in the next chapter.
By the goal nearest the water, the absent canoemen
were standing, a goodly heap of game piled at their
feet. The moment they caught sight of their boat
they drew the attention of the players to it; these
immediately abandoned the game and, running to the
farther goal, picked up muskets and hastened with
them towards the quay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is something new,&rdquo; said Bigsby, &ldquo;and I
don&rsquo;t like the look of it. For whom do they take us?&rdquo;
He took a pistol from his bag, and Rocheblanc did the
same; then, looking towards the bank again, they saw
that every redskin had pointed his gun-muzzle on the
boat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think it is only a salute,&rdquo; said the priest, &ldquo;though
I must confess I have never been so honoured before.
They are harmless, hard-working men, and all know me
perfectly well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had scarcely finished speaking when the guns
began to go off in twos and threes and sixes, anyhow,
in fact. Then the surgeon put away his pistol and
laughed, for there was not a splash on the water
anywhere.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Father was right; it&rsquo;s only a salute. Do
they often do this?&rdquo; he asked of the nearest of the
canoemen. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve not seen it before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Indian looked very knowing and mysterious,
and, after a pause, answered:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a royal salute. They only fire like this for a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_58' name='page_58'></a>58</span>
great Iroquois chief, or for a messenger from the
white king.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Very soon another succession of reports came, the
guns all the while trained so accurately on the boat
that even Bigsby, fresh from three years&rsquo; constant
active service at the Cape, began earnestly to hope
that no one had, in the excitement of the moment,
dropped a bullet into a gun-muzzle by mistake.
Before the muskets could be loaded a third time the
travellers were safely at the landing-stage.</p>
<p>At other Indian villages the doctor had noticed
that the priest was always subjected to lengthy
greetings, speechifyings, and very elaborate homage.
The homage and the greetings were not absent to-day,
but they were of the hurried and perfunctory sort,
for everyone, after a word and an obeisance to his
reverend fellow-traveller, turned to Bigsby himself;
and the old chief, coming forward with tremulous
respect, began to address a long oration to him,
calling him the lord of lakes and forests, the father of
the red man, the slayer of beasts, and a score of other
titles; in short, &ldquo;describing him ever so much better
than he knew himself,&rdquo; as John Ridd says. While he
was stammering out a suitable acknowledgment in
French, the parish priest came hurrying to greet his
superior, and then the mystery was explained, for
Père Tabeau introduced the lord of lakes, etc., to him
as plain &ldquo;Surgeon Bigsby.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">curé</i> laughed heartily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I understand. Your uniform is responsible for
all this, monsieur. Your boatmen had told us that an
ambassador from the king was coming with the Père
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_59' name='page_59'></a>59</span>
Supérieur.&rdquo; He pointed at the doctor&rsquo;s regimental
coat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then that is why all the canoemen have been so
distant and servile with me to-day,&rdquo; said the young
surgeon. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve not been able to get a word out of
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Usually he wore a perfectly plain, blue relief-jacket,
but on this particular morning he had donned a very
old scarlet tunic, of the dragoon regiment to which he
belonged, merely because the day happened to be too
chilly for the thin serge jacket, and not cold enough
for him to trouble about unpacking a winter coat;
and if this had raised him in the canoemen&rsquo;s estimation,
he had been quite unconscious of it. As a matter of
fact, when the Indians left the boat that morning,
they had already made of him a British potentate
who was at last throwing off his disguise, and this
they honestly believed him to be; but, before the
morning was out, their imagination had run away
with them so far as to promote him to the rank of
envoy extraordinary; in other words, they had
exaggerated, as more civilised people sometimes will,
for the sake of a little reflected greatness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Rocheblanc,&rdquo; said the doctor, &ldquo;if you will
lend me a spare coat till I unpack to-night, I think I
can sweeten that chief&rsquo;s declining years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A coat was soon produced, and, to the wonderment
of the Indians, Bigsby removed the old tunic which,
with a grave bow, he begged the old chief to accept
as a memento. So great, indeed, was the surprise of
the redskins that the donor was in no danger of the
contempt which they might otherwise have shown
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_60' name='page_60'></a>60</span>
for a broken idol&mdash;a daw despoiled of its peacock&rsquo;s
plumage. Such liberality was stupefying.</p>
<p>But the chief was not to be outdone in self-sacrifice.
After a tremendous struggle with himself he stifled
his vanity and desire for possession, and turning to the
old parish priest, begged him to wear the garment, as
being more worthy of the honour; nor was it till he
was made to understand that, neither in nor out of
church, would it be seemly for the staid old clergyman
to go flaunting in a cavalry officer&rsquo;s scarlet and gold,
that the chief would consent to wear it. And then his
appearance and his self-satisfaction were such that
none of the white men dared look at him for long,
lest they should hurt the dear old fellow&rsquo;s feelings by a
burst of laughter.</p>
<p>The gift led to an invitation to dinner from the
chief, so persistent and impassioned that it was
impossible for the visitors to refuse it, though the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">curé</i>
had a meal awaiting them at his presbytery. And
now the doctor was to achieve even greater popularity,
for the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">curé</i>, who usually acted as village surgeon and
herbalist, took the opportunity of asking his advice
in the case of a baby of one of the parishioners that
suffered from what seemed to be incurable fits. Bigsby
at once went to examine the child and recommended
the application of a little blistering lotion to the back
of the neck; he sent to the boat for his medicine-case,
gave the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">curé</i> a small supply of the lotion, and instructed
him how to make more. This was, of course, the signal
for everyone in the village to require doctoring.
Ailments were discovered or invented with astonishing
rapidity, and the whole time, till dinner was ready,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_61' name='page_61'></a>61</span>
was occupied in feeling pulses, drawing teeth, lancing
abscesses, and salving sores. But if the surgeon had
been a vain man, the reverence paid to his skill would
have been ample reward.</p>
<p>At last the white men were conducted in state to the
chief&rsquo;s hut. The dinner was laid on the floor, and mats
and cushions arranged round it in a circle; the two
priests sat on the chief&rsquo;s right, the doctor and Rocheblanc
on his left, and his son opposite him, while the
wife and the daughter-in-law brought in, helped, and
handed round the various courses. The first of these
was <i lang="iro" xml:lang="iro">sowete</i>, a really villainous concoction of bruised
sunflower seeds, <i lang="iro" xml:lang="iro">camash</i> (a very insipid kind of truffle),
and the gristly parts of some fish-heads, all boiled
together to the consistency of porridge. Of this the
guests ate sparingly, and of the next course not at all,
though it looked and smelt so inviting that Bigsby
and the fur-trader would have done full justice to it,
had it not been for a warning look from Père Tabeau,
and the ejaculation of the single word &ldquo;Puppy!&rdquo;
which was lost upon the Indians, as they spoke only
the Canadian <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">patois</i> and their own Iroquoian. The
dish might have been a roasted hare; but Bigsby
suddenly recalled, with a shudder, having seen a fresh
dog-skin spread to dry on the outside wall of the hut.
But the remaining courses were unexceptionable:
various fish, a kind of grouse, venison, and a right good
beefsteak to finish with.</p>
<p>The chief implored his guests to stay for at least one
night, but the mission superior had an appointment
early the following day; and, when he had inspected
the parish books, all returned to the boat,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_62' name='page_62'></a>62</span>
conducted by the red-habited chief. At the landing-stage
the canoemen were busy stowing away presents
which half the parish had brought down for the
mighty medicine man: fruits of all kinds, small
cheeses, carvings on horn, bone, and wood, and&mdash;to
Bigsby&rsquo;s great delight&mdash;several lumps of nickel and
copper ore and some bits of gold quartz. These he
knew were to be found in the vicinity, though he
had not yet succeeded in discovering them; and
here were valuable specimens which he might have
spent weeks in trying to find.</p>
<p>As a good deal of time had been lost, no halt was
made that night, each man sleeping in the boat,
where and when and how he could; and, long before
noon of the following day, the next stopping-place
was reached. This was a small fur-trading centre
where Rocheblanc also had affairs to transact; and
he and Père Tabeau went about their respective
business, agreeing to meet the doctor at the boat at
three o&rsquo;clock.</p>
<p>Bigsby, having nothing special to do, explored the
tiny settlement and, strolling a mile inland, collected
one or two geological specimens. This occupation
attracted a knot of Indian idlers, who stood gaping at
the childishness of a white man who could find nothing
better to do than picking stones off the road, throwing
them down again or putting them in his pocket, and
varying these puerilities by producing a hammer and
knocking chips off unoffending wayside boulders.
Geologists and painters are too much accustomed to
being stared at, as marvels or lunatics, to heed such
curiosity; and it was not till he heard a strident voice
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_63' name='page_63'></a>63</span>
in French, ordering the Indians to go away, that he
even troubled to turn his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Sales chiens</i>,&rdquo; &ldquo;<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">salauds</i>,&rdquo; and &ldquo;<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sacrés cochons</i>&rdquo;
were the mildest terms that were being hurled at the
simple redskins by an over-dressed and much-bejewelled
being whose European toilette could not conceal the
fact that he was a negro-Indian (or a Zambo, as he
would have been termed farther south), with possibly
a streak of white blood in him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Out of the way, reptiles, redskinned animals,&rdquo; he
shouted. &ldquo;White gentlemen don&rsquo;t want to be pestered
by you,&rdquo; and pushing his way roughly through the
little crowd, he came and stood by the scientist,
bestowing on him a most princely bow and a gracious
smile.</p>
<p>Now as Bigsby had not sought this very loud young
man&rsquo;s acquaintance, and wouldn&rsquo;t have had it at any
price he could have offered him, he took no notice of
him beyond a civil nod, and returned to his task of
examining a chip of quartz with a pocket-lens. But
the Zambo, having established the fact that he was
&ldquo;somebody&rdquo; in these parts by driving away the
shrinking natives, endeavoured to press on the doctor
a card that bore a string of names beginning with
César Auguste and ending with the historic surname
of de Valois. Convinced that the man was not sober,
and unwilling to be the centre of a disturbance,
Bigsby turned away with a curt &ldquo;good morning&rdquo;
and followed the retreating Indians.</p>
<p>At three o&rsquo;clock he returned to the boat. The
others were already in their places, and sitting next
to Rocheblanc was a coloured person, resplendent in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_64' name='page_64'></a>64</span>
white hat, fur-collared surtout, and an infinite number
of waistcoats, pins, brooches, chains, and rings; Dr.
Bigsby&rsquo;s acquaintance of a few hours before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I took the liberty of inviting Mr. de Valois to join
us as far as the next station, where he has business,&rdquo;
said Rocheblanc, who, like the Indians, seemed more
or less in awe of the stranger. Bigsby concealed his
annoyance and comforted himself with the reflection
that the next station would be reached in less than
three hours&rsquo; time. It turned out that the fellow was
a millionaire fur-buyer, with whom Rocheblanc had
often done business and wished to do more, and who,
from his great size, his wealth, his powers of bullying,
and his pretensions to white blood, was a terror to all
the more civilised Indians. To the doctor, as a &ldquo;king&rsquo;s
officer,&rdquo; he condescended to be more friendly than
was desired; but his manner towards the two
Canadians was insufferably patronising, while a curse
or a kick was the sole form of notice he could spare
for the canoemen, and that only when they happened
to splash him. Father Tabeau and the doctor pocketed
their disgust as well as they could, and Rocheblanc
endeavoured to hold his guest tightly down to business
conversation. The worst of it was that the canoemen,
though strong, able fellows, seemed fascinated by
their fear of him, and had it not been still broad
daylight, a serious accident might have happened to the
boat. Even as it was, the men paddled nervously and
irregularly, more than once getting her into a crosscurrent,
and growing only more frightened and helpless
as the half-breed became noisier and more abusive.</p>

<p class='caption'>
<span class='smcap'>A Bully Well Served</span><br />
<br />
The over-dressed Zambo, after bullying the canoemen to the verge of mutiny, was ordered by Bigsby to leave the canoe. The bully clenched his fist, but Bigsby planted a powerful blow on his throat, and sent him right over the gunwale.<br />
</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;ll be trouble if we&rsquo;re not careful, Father,&rdquo;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_65' name='page_65'></a>65</span>
said Bigsby in English, now at the end of his patience.
&ldquo;If you&rsquo;ll allow me I&rsquo;ll try and get rid of him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He made a sign to the Indians to pull sharply in,
which Mr. de Valois did not perceive. But, when the
confused redskins suddenly ran the boat among a
number of projecting stakes, where an old landing-stage
had been broken up, the Zambo, splashed and
shaken, began to behave like a maniac. He jumped
up, cane in hand, and lashed the three nearest Indians
savagely over the head and face, swearing, gesticulating,
and threatening till the doctor was minded
to pitch him into the water straight away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Steady her; hold by those stakes,&rdquo; he cried to the
men in the bow, who, being farthest from the stick,
were the coolest. Then, throwing himself between
the half-breed and the canoemen, he said, &ldquo;There&rsquo;s
one redskin too many here, my man, and I think <em>you&rsquo;d</em>
better clear out,&rdquo; and at the same time he wrenched
the stick from his hand and flung it on shore.</p>
<p>The bully clenched his fist, but again Bigsby was too
quick for him, and planted a powerful blow neatly
under his throat; he staggered, tried to steady
himself, and, in so doing, toppled clean over the gunwale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right; push off,&rdquo; said Bigsby coolly. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s
got plenty to catch hold of there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The water was still fairly deep, but the stakes were
so numerous that even a non-swimmer could be in no
danger. The boat was soon in clear water again, and
C&aelig;sar Augustus could now be seen&mdash;a truly pitiable
figure&mdash;helping himself ashore from stump to stump,
a sadder if not a wiser man.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_66' name='page_66'></a>66</span></div>
<p>Bigsby never had the felicity of seeing him again,
but he heard, some months later, that his power over
the redskins was very much diminished, and that he
had grown considerably less ready to domineer over
the race which certainly had more claim to him than
any other.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>
<h3>CREEK INDIANS AT PLAY</h3>
</div>
<p>A great deal of abuse has been poured, from
time to time, on the United States Government
for its treatment of the North American Indians.
In point of fact, much of this abuse was quite
undeserved, for, as the well-known traveller, Captain
Basil Hall, R.N., has shown, constant endeavours
were made by Congress to render the savages self-supporting;
large grants of money and land were given
to those who were dispossessed of their forest or prairie
homes, and the remainder were allowed and encouraged
to preserve as many of their own customs and laws
as were not connected with blood-feud or revolt.</p>
<p>The redskins with whom Captain Hall came most
in touch were the Creeks, who&mdash;with the Choctaws,
Chicasas, etc.&mdash;belong to the great Muskhogean
family, at one time the possessors of Kentucky,
Tennessee, Georgia, Alabama, and Florida. When the
Captain first set foot in the State of Georgia, in 1828,
he knew little or nothing of the Indians, save from
books; and on entering upon the prairies near the
Savannah River, he was prepared for adventures
thrilling and abundant. He and his attendants were
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_68' name='page_68'></a>68</span>
all well armed, for they had before them a lonely ride
that would occupy two days, to a small Government
settlement on the edge of a hilly forest, where they
were to meet a United States agent to whom the
Captain had letters of introduction.</p>
<p>They rode all that day, however, without meeting
a soul; and the greater part of the next also. Then,
as they crossed a stream which formed a natural
frontier between prairie and forest, smoke became
visible among the trees, and, shortly after, the travellers
began to catch glimpses, not of the wigwams which
they had looked to see, but of tarred log huts that
were certainly not the work of unreclaimed savages.
But every man examined the loading of his firearms
and prepared to defend himself: a very needless
precaution, as it turned out. For, amid a confused
barking of dogs and screaming of women, a dozen
or more redskins crept gloomily out from one or other
of the huts, and Captain Hall&rsquo;s heart sank in chill
disappointment. Were <em>these</em> the noble savages whom,
all his life, he had burned to see? The &ldquo;Black
Eagles&rdquo; and &ldquo;Sparrowhawks&rdquo; and &ldquo;Pathfinders&rdquo;
of the romance-writers?</p>
<p>The skinny, stooping, half-starved-looking group
drew near. Not one carried arms, not one appeared
to have nerve enough to slay a spring chicken;
and the moment the white men reined up, all began a
chorus of whining appeals for tobacco, drink, or
money, such as you may hear from the gypsies along
the Epsom Road. Hall hastily distributed some
small change and a handful of cigars and rode on again,
having scarcely the heart to look round on the dismal
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_69' name='page_69'></a>69</span>
little village with its scolding women, its disreputable
fowls and dogs, and its little company of loafing, unkempt
men, the most energetic of whom could find no
more vigorous employment than the making of toy
bows and arrows for sale, or the listless sowing of
seeds in ground that had never been properly dug.
And <em>these</em> were the famous Creek Indians!</p>
<p>But compensation for the disappointment awaited
him when, some hours later, the forest path which he
was following widened into a large clearing where
wigwams, as well as permanent huts, well-fed horses,
and camp fires announced at least a more virile
and natural form of life. A robust and well-dressed
young white man came running out of the first and
largest of the huts and, greeting the Captain warmly,
introduced himself as the Government agent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, pooh! They&rsquo;re not all so bad as that,&rdquo; he
said when, seated over a comfortable meal in the hut,
Captain Hall dwelt on what he had seen at the edge
of the forest. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re only the dregs and leavings.
I&rsquo;ll show you something different to that by and by.
Poor beggars; I&rsquo;m afraid they&rsquo;ve no one but themselves
to thank for their condition.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you make that out?&rdquo; asked the Englishman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, when Congress claimed that bit of prairie
land, these fellows were given the patch where you
saw them&mdash;and considerable money grants as well.
They went off to the towns and spent the money like
children, and when they hadn&rsquo;t got a red cent left,
calculated to try farming. I reckon you saw the sort
of farming <em>they</em> go in for, Captain. They&rsquo;re too lazy
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_70' name='page_70'></a>70</span>
to fell the trees, let alone grub out the roots or break
up the soil. We&rsquo;ve given &rsquo;em corn for seed, but they
only chaw it up and then come back and ask for more.
They had the option of coming out here, but they
ain&rsquo;t partial to forest hunting; they won&rsquo;t help
themselves, and they won&rsquo;t let us help them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what&rsquo;s the good of their coming out here if you
fellows are going to turn them off when you think
good?&rdquo; asked the Captain.</p>
<p>The agent shrugged his shoulders. &ldquo;Look here, sir,
these chaps won&rsquo;t be disturbed for another twenty
years. The chiefs have had fair warning, and if they
don&rsquo;t turn to and help themselves before then, it&rsquo;ll
be their own look-out. Finer men you needn&rsquo;t wish
to see&mdash;at present.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hall felt that the last remark was fully justified
when, later in the evening, his new friend conducted
him to the middle of the clearing, where the whole
tribe had foregathered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t have come at a better time, Captain,&rdquo;
said the Yankee. &ldquo;To-morrow&rsquo;s their Derby Day,
University match, or whatever you like to call it&mdash;the
greatest day of the year. A team of up-forest
Creeks is now on the way to play against them at
ball.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ball?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, you&rsquo;ll see to-morrow. Come and be presented
to the chiefs now&mdash;and mind the dogs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The caution was needful enough, for at the entry of
every hut or wigwam was a brace of half-wild Indian
hounds, each fastened by a thong to a stump, and
ready to spring on the unwary.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_71' name='page_71'></a>71</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s all the din about?&rdquo; asked Hall, as they
came to the village square or <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">place</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Local band,&rdquo; said the American briefly, and just
then they came upon the gifted instrumentalists,
two in number, though making noise enough for two
dozen. One &ldquo;uneasy imp of darkness&rdquo; was beating
with his fist a drum made of deer-skin stretched over
a short length of hollow tree-trunk; the other had a
gourd, so dry that it resembled wood, which contained
a double handful of pebbles and which he shook as
a child shakes a rattle, only with more disastrous
results to Christian ears.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;square&rdquo; was formed by four long huts or
pavilions, in one of which sat an assembly of chiefs,
cross-legged and smoking; and to these the Captain
was introduced with a good deal of ceremony. In the
middle of the quadrangle was an enormous fire of pitch-pine,
and, between it and the hut where Hall was now
seated, were over twenty young women, who sat&mdash;in
accordance with local etiquette&mdash;with their backs
turned to the chiefs and visitors. These were the
dancers, and at a given signal they all rose, and went
through some man&oelig;uvres far more tedious than
interesting.</p>
<p>Perhaps the Englishman&rsquo;s face showed that he was
bored, for the oldest of the braves ordered the dancing
to cease after a while, and remarking to the agent that
he had something in store that <em>would</em> amuse the
stranger, banged a copper vessel which did duty for a
gong. Immediately thirty fine young men sprang
up from various quarters of the court, and made a
dash for a heap of sticks or clubs which lay close to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_72' name='page_72'></a>72</span>
where the white men were sitting. Certainly these
Indians were a contrast to the poor wretches encountered
at the edge of the wood; every one of them
looked as hard as iron and as agile as a puma. Uttering
fearful shrieks, and swinging their clubs round their
heads, they performed the wild sort of war-dance
that Captain Hall had heard of and had despaired
of seeing, and followed it up with a series of very
ingenious and difficult somersaults, round and round
the fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s only the first part of the preparation for
to-morrow,&rdquo; said the agent. &ldquo;Come along, we must
go to the town hall for the second.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They followed the chiefs to a very large circular hut
beyond the far side of the square, which was lighted
and heated by another pitch-pine fire; and they had
no sooner sat down than the thirty athletes crowded
into the building and at once stripped off ornaments
and clothes. Supporting the roof were six stanchions,
and to each of these one of the Indians betook himself
and stood embracing it. Then six of the chiefs rose
solemnly, and at once every voice was hushed. Each
of these had provided himself with a short stick, at
the end of which was a tiny rake&mdash;in some cases
consisting of a row of garfish teeth, in others of a dozen
or more iron needle-points, with their blunt ends stuck
in a corn-cob. Every chief approached his man, and
having drenched him from head to foot with water,
commenced an operation calculated to set any civilised
man&rsquo;s teeth and nerves on edge.</p>
<p><em>Scroop-scroop</em>, sounded the rakes, like razors being
drawn over very bristly chins; and Captain Hall
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_73' name='page_73'></a>73</span>
realised that these young men had given themselves
up to be scraped and scarified with the rows of teeth.
All stood quite passive while both thighs, both calves,
and both upper-arms were scored with cuts seven or
eight inches in length, the pleasantness of which
proceeding may be gauged by the fact that, in a few
minutes, the victims were bathed in blood from heel
to shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what&rsquo;s it <em>for</em>?&rdquo; whispered the Captain,
fretted by the long silence and the whole uncanny
exhibition, as batch after batch of athletes submitted
themselves to the ordeal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They reckon it makes them more limber for
to-morrow&rsquo;s performance,&rdquo; explained the agent.
&ldquo;They&rsquo;re the &lsquo;ball&rsquo; team, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Captain Hall had seen enough for one day, but
early the next morning he rode further into the forest
with his guide, towards the playing ground, some
six miles away. This turned out to be another clearing&mdash;a
space two hundred yards by twenty, at either
end of which were two large green boughs stuck six
feet apart in the earth, evidently meant to act as some
sort of goals.</p>
<p>Here was the ground, right enough, and batches of
spectators were continually adding themselves to
those already in attendance. But where were the
players, and what were they going to play?</p>
<p>&ldquo;They go to meet the other team,&rdquo; said the agent;
&ldquo;and they usually take their time over getting here,
for there&rsquo;ll be a score or two of private fights, that
have been carried over from last year, to settle by
the way.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_74' name='page_74'></a>74</span></div>
<p>When the white men had waited for more than two
hours, they lost patience and rode further into the forest
in search of the rival companies, guiding themselves
more or less by the warlike howls that proceeded
from the distance. And presently they came upon
the bulk of the missing men, some walking in twos and
threes, others stopping to adjust private grievances
with the strangers or their own people (they did not
seem particular), and a third contingent lying in the
rank grass, singing war-songs, sleeping, smoking, or
bedizening themselves. These latter, who had left the
putting on of their bravery till the eleventh hour,
were painting their eyelids (one black and the other
yellow) and adorning their persons artistically with
feathers and the tails of monkeys or wild cats. Clearly
it would be idle to suggest their hurrying themselves;
and the Captain and his conductor rode back to the
field very much at their leisure.</p>
<p>Shortly after midday, however, both teams arrived,
and having inspected the ground for a bare minute,
made a sudden stampede, each side for its own goal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s one thing, they don&rsquo;t waste any time
about beginning, when they <em>do</em> get here,&rdquo; said Hall
relievedly, at which remark the agent only grinned.</p>
<p>In another moment an appalling chorus of yells
arose from the neighbourhood of either goal, and
both teams began to dance like madmen, waving
over their heads the sticks with which they were going
to play.</p>
<p>And now&mdash;imagine the Oxford and Cambridge
crews, as a preliminary to the race, gathering one on
either bank and bawling derisively at each other,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_75' name='page_75'></a>75</span>
cursing like bargemen and screaming themselves hoarse
in a struggle as to which side could make the more
noise and utter the grosser invective or the more
offensive personalities. This is what these unsophisticated
savages were doing, and continued to do for
a good twenty minutes, the one lot recalling to the
other&rsquo;s memory former defeats or instances of foul
play, the other replying with both wholesale and
individual charges of lying, theft, etc. Then, when the
abuse began to grow monotonous, it dropped suddenly;
and, at a sign from one of the chiefs, both parties
advanced to the centre and laid down their sticks.
These were bits of well-seasoned wood, two feet long
and split at one end, the fork thus made being laced
across with sinew or skin, so forming a small and very
rough sort of tennis-racquet.</p>
<p>A deputation of braves advanced, examined the
sticks severally, and carefully counted the men
(thirty on each side), and, this being done to universal
satisfaction, a chief harangued the teams for a quarter
of an hour, bidding them &ldquo;play the game.&rdquo; Having
finished his speech, he told them to pick up their
sticks&mdash;each player had two&mdash;and go to their places;
whereupon they distributed themselves much as we
should do at football or hockey, each goal, however,
being guarded by <em>two</em> men. When all were ready the
committee of elders passed the ball from hand to
hand, each inspecting it gravely to see that it satisfied
the regulations. It was a soft, rough edition of an
ordinary cricket-ball, being made of raw hide, neatly
stitched, and stuffed with horse-hair.</p>
<p>By this time Hall had begun to understand why his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_76' name='page_76'></a>76</span>
companion had smiled so subtly at his anticipation
of a speedy commencement. They had tethered
their horses some distance away, and had secured for
themselves a point of vantage near the scorers. At
last the old chief threw the ball in the air and beat a
hasty retreat. As it fell it was caught deftly by one of
the home team between his two bats, and, regardless
of tripping, kicking, punching, and snatching on the
part of the other side, he began bravely to force a way
towards the opposite goal, backed up sturdily by his
fellows, who were waiting for him to throw the ball to
them as soon as he saw himself brought to a final stop
by his adversaries. And thus the match proceeded,
being&mdash;as may be seen&mdash;not at all unlike our Rugby
game; and whenever a goal was scored by either
team, the delirious shouting of the spectators might
have added to the impression of a modern onlooker
that he was witnessing a Crystal Palace cup tie.</p>
<p>But there were two respects in which their rules
would have profited by a little overhauling. We
consider an hour and a half ample time for a match to
last; but, though Captain Hall watched the Indians&rsquo;
game for five hours, it was not quite finished when he
left. Twenty &ldquo;was the game,&rdquo; and any footballer
knows that that number of goals is not to be scored
all in a hurry, when both teams are equally active,
powerful, and skilled men. The scoring, by the way&mdash;or
the counting of the goals&mdash;was done by the two
mathematicians of the tribe, each of whom was supplied
with ten sticks, and stuck one of them in the ground
every time a goal was gained by his side. The dear old
gentlemen could not count above ten, so, when the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_77' name='page_77'></a>77</span>
eleventh goal had to be marked, the sticks were pulled
up and the reckoning was begun a second time.</p>

<span class='smcap'>A Game at Ball</span><br />
<br />
This game is a mixture of tennis, lacrosse, and Rugby football. The rules are few and simple, the object being to gain possession of the ball by any means and hurl it between the goalposts of the opponents. The safety or comfort of the onlookers is of no consequence whatever.<br />
</p>
</div>
<p>The other direction in which the Indian laws cried
loudly for amendment concerned the spectators
even more closely than the players. There was no
&ldquo;touch&rdquo; line, nor was the ball, no matter where it
went, ever regarded as <em>in</em> &ldquo;touch.&rdquo; With a pitch
only twenty yards wide, it will easily be seen that the
ball was, from time to time, knocked or thrown
among the onlookers; but that was their own affair,
argued the players, who rushed pell-mell among them,
screaming and struggling, hitting or kicking, or
trampling right and left.</p>
<p>Indeed, it was one of these wild rushes that was
the means of bringing Captain Hall&rsquo;s interest in the
contest to an abrupt end. The ball had come within a
yard or two of him, plump between the two scorers,
each of whom wisely made an instantaneous dash
into the open and so avoided the onrush of the players.
If Hall had had two more seconds at his disposal he
would have seized the ball and flung it into play
again; but the sportsmen were too near.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tree, tree,&rdquo; shouted the agent behind him; and
waiting for no second reminder, the active sailor
sprang at the bough above him and hoisted himself
into safety just as the crowd swarmed over and half
killed a boy who was trying to follow him into the
tree.</p>
<p>When the ball was safely on the other side of the
ground he climbed down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going,&rdquo; he said resolutely.</p>
<p>They reached their horses and were riding slowly
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_78' name='page_78'></a>78</span>
back towards the village when shouts resounded
behind them, eclipsing the loudest and noisiest of
any they had heard that day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The end of the game,&rdquo; said Hall. &ldquo;Our side were
nineteen when we came away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, the end of the game,&rdquo; assented the young
American; &ldquo;and the beginning of the fighting. The
losers are getting ready to whop the winners. Are
you keen on going back again?&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>
<h3>WITH THE DELAWARES AND CREES</h3>
</div>
<p>Sir George Head, elder brother of the great
South American explorer and Colonial Governor,
was a sort of Ralegh on a small scale, inasmuch
as he figured in the various rôles of sailor, soldier,
traveller, and courtier. The greater part of his time
from 1814 to 1830 was spent in and about Nova
Scotia, Quebec, and Ungava, his military duties at
Halifax, as chief of the commissariat, giving him
plenty of opportunity for combining pleasure with
business in long journeys northward.</p>
<p>Late in the autumn of 1828 he set out on a tour
north-westwards from Halifax, intending to devote
his six months&rsquo; furlough to hunting among the Cree
Indians of New Brunswick and Eastern Quebec.
It was not a journey that would commend itself to
people who love the sun and the fireside, for though
the district for which he was making is in the same
latitude as Cornwall, the average winter temperature
may be put down as 19° F. A coach took him and his
servant across country as far as the Annapolis Basin,
whence it was only a sixty-mile run by steam packet
to St. John; and here there was no difficulty in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_80' name='page_80'></a>80</span>
obtaining a large canoe with three Delaware Indians
to paddle it and act as guides.</p>
<p>Of the St. John River, up which quite big steamers
travel over two hundred miles nowadays, comparatively
little was then known, except its lower reaches,
and its source, which lies north-westwards in the
State of Maine; and even the Indian guides would not
undertake to go many miles beyond Fredericton.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean by &lsquo;many miles beyond&rsquo;?&rdquo;
asked Major Head, when, on passing that town some
days later, the Indians reminded him of their contract.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ten miles, or perhaps fifteen. We are strangers
beyond that, and, though the Cree Indians are akin
to us, they do not love us.&rdquo; This was perfectly true,
for the Crees, Blackfeet, and other of the less civilised
Algonquin redskins despised the Delaware Indians as
mere cockneys.</p>
<p>In the end, the guides promised that they would
go as far as the next town, which was twenty miles
farther, admitting that they might possibly have
business there. The nature of that business soon
leaked out, for suddenly the Indian in the bow dropped
his paddle, snatched up a spear from a small bundle of
those implements that lay to hand, leant over the
side, and brought up a salmon nearly three feet long.
The other canoemen at once abandoned their paddling
and stood expectant, spear in hand. The Major
had never caught salmon in any other way than with
rod and line, and he, too, took up a spear, determined
to distinguish himself; but, though they waited
patiently for another hour, not a second fish was seen,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_81' name='page_81'></a>81</span>
and at length the Indians picked up their paddles
again and moved on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We may get some to-night,&rdquo; said one of them;
&ldquo;though it is almost too late in the year. Nearly all
of them have reached the sea by this time, but it was
worth our while to come so far on speculation. Between
Fredericton and the sea there is little chance of catching
anything, for the timber rafters frighten all the fish,
so that they seldom rise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At evening they landed to make their camp for the
night; but, soon after supper, instead of lying down
as usual, the Delawares announced that they were
going fishing. By way of a preliminary, each lighted
a substantial brand of pitch-pine, and, taking up their
spears, got into the boat again, Head following them.
And this time there appeared to be considerably more
chance for the fishermen; the silence and darkness
and loneliness of the spot were, of course, in their favour,
but of even more importance were the torches, which
would appeal to the curiosity of any salmon that might
be about. Even in daylight the Indian fishermen more
often than not regard a flame of some sort as a necessary
adjunct to their work.</p>
<p>Sport opened briskly and brilliantly. Long before
the Englishman&rsquo;s eyes had accustomed themselves
to looking down into the water by this constantly
moving artificial light, the Indians had caught over
a dozen fish; and still the silly creatures came peeping
to the surface or hovering a few feet below it.</p>
<p>With the &ldquo;beginner&rsquo;s luck&rdquo; that is proverbial,
the first salmon that came within his reach fell an easy
prey to the Major&rsquo;s spear, so easy, in fact, that the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_82' name='page_82'></a>82</span>
redskins smiled broadly at his triumphant satisfaction,
for they knew that it was the one happy chance in a
million. He began to think so, too, when, time after
time, he darted the spear into the water without
making a second catch. His eye and hand were well
trained to every kind of sport; and, of course, he knew
that hitting an object in water and out of water are
two very different things. Over and over again he
would have taken an oath that his spear had struck
its mark, and yet it came up empty. He grew more
and more impatient and venturesome, and, in the end,
naturally met with the reward that he might have
expected: lost his balance and went heels over head
into the water.</p>
<p>He was a bold and strong man who had faced danger
and death in many forms, but the icy chill of that
water almost prompted him to scream out; and, as it
gurgled and bubbled over his ears, he decided that his
chance of ever getting out of it alive was but small,
for he was wearing top-boots, thick leather breeches,
a seal-skin jacket, and a heavy overcoat. Nevertheless,
he struck out desperately and reached the surface
again. If he could only keep himself up for a few
seconds he was safe. At once catching sight of him,
one of the Indians uttered a shout, leant forward
with his paddle, and held it towards the drowning
man. A couple of laboured strokes brought him near
enough to clutch the blade of it, and he was speedily
drawn to the stern of the boat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold there,&rdquo; cried the Indian. &ldquo;No, don&rsquo;t do
that,&rdquo; for Head was trying might and main to draw
himself up. As every swimmer knows, it is not the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_83' name='page_83'></a>83</span>
easiest thing in the world to get into a light boat
from the water, even when one has no clothes on and is
not numbed to the very marrow with cold.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What on earth are you trying to do?&rdquo; he
spluttered, as the other two Delawares also took up
their paddles. What they were about to do was soon
clear enough; they meant to tow him ashore, for
suddenly the paddles flashed through the water and,
despite the weight behind it, the canoe moved rapidly
towards the bank.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait a minute, you precious fools,&rdquo; gasped the
Major wrathfully; but they never so much as turned
their heads. True, he had never seen a canoe move so
swiftly in all his life, yet those forty or fifty yards
to the bank were like miles, and when, springing
ashore, two of the Indians bent over to help him out
of the water, he could scarcely use his feet to scramble
up the low bank.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why ever didn&rsquo;t you pull me out straight away,
or keep still till I got into the boat?&rdquo; he asked, as he
stood and shivered before the fire while his man gave
him a rub down with a blanket. The Delawares
looked grave and wise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are a tall and a heavy man. You might have
upset the boat&mdash;and then we should have lost all our
fish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sir George does not record the answer that he
made to these curmudgeonly rascals who preferred
endangering a man&rsquo;s life to the risk of losing a few
salmon. But perhaps they were only having their
revenge on him for having spoilt their night&rsquo;s work by
driving away all the fish.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_84' name='page_84'></a>84</span></div>
<p>The next afternoon, fishing and paddling by turns,
they came to a town or village of some pretensions&mdash;the
last on the river. Head again tried to persuade
the Indians to agree to go farther, but fruitlessly;
and their utmost concession was that, as one of their
number was going into the town to buy some goods
while the others sold their fish at the wharf, he would
make inquiries about procuring new guides. The Major
sent his man across with the luggage to the only
decent inn of the place, and himself idled about the
jetty, talking to the remaining Indians and their
customers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has found a guide for you,&rdquo; said one of the
Delawares at last, pointing to a strange figure that
came stalking along the quay behind the third Indian.</p>
<p>The new arrival was a middle-aged man of such
ferocious aspect that Head fancied he could foresee
trouble before they had gone far together. He was one
of the Crees, and his personal beauty&mdash;probably never
at any time great&mdash;was not improved by the scars and
tattoo marks that covered his face, arms, and chest.
Cold though the weather was becoming, he was naked,
but for his moccasins and a sort of kilt or petticoat
made of feathers and deer-skin. His hair, also decorated
with feathers, extended to his waist, and he wore a
string of odds and ends round his neck: glass beads,
teeth, bits of metal, coins, and buttons. He carried
a broad-bladed spear nearly eight feet high in one
hand, and an enormous club in the other, while from
his neck or shoulders hung bow, quiver, tomahawk,
and two knives.</p>
<p>Head, who spoke the Algonquin dialect perfectly
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_85' name='page_85'></a>85</span>
well, bade him give some account of himself, and he
replied, in a voice whose mildness scarcely fitted his
fierce and repulsive appearance, that he had ridden
down from his camp near Presque Isle (in Maine) to
guide a Yankee fur-trader across the New Brunswick
boundary, and had now been waiting two days on the
chance of a similar job for his return journey.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who did you suppose would be likely to be going
up there from <em>here</em>?&rdquo; asked the soldier suspiciously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are many French people who come from here
to buy our furs. Is it not true?&rdquo; The new guide
turned fiercely on the Delawares for confirmation,
and they nodded, making little effort to disguise their
fear of him. Hitherto they had generally shown themselves
cool-headed enough, but in the presence of this
forest savage they seemed afraid to say that their
souls were their own.</p>
<p>Head reflected that he was becoming very tired
of the river, and further, that it might now be frozen
hard any day. Moreover, it was but a roundabout
way of travelling compared to the forest, which,
being only of pine and spruce, offered none of the
obstructions of the creeper-clad woods farther south.
Could he hire or buy horses? he asked of a negro
working close at hand. Ay, any number of them;
mustangs were being brought over the boundary
every day by enterprising Americans, and could be
bought for a couple of pounds a head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, then.&rdquo; The Major turned to the Cree
again. &ldquo;Call for me at the inn to-morrow morning
at nine, and I shall be ready to start.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Arrangements were soon made as to horses, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_86' name='page_86'></a>86</span>
Head, who had not slept without his clothes for a
week, and might not see a Christian bed for weeks
to come, went off to his room, resolved upon at least
one night&rsquo;s good rest. Coming down to his breakfast
in the morning, he found that his man had put out,
cleaned, and loaded a pair of pistols for him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Beg pardon, Major; most disreputable-looking
party that guide, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well&mdash;yes; we don&rsquo;t want to know too many of
his sort. We&rsquo;ll keep an eye on him in case he has
some idea of leading us into an ambush; but don&rsquo;t
let him imagine that we suspect him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Head had finished his breakfast and was strolling
into the yard at the back of the house to see if the
horses were ready, when a violent uproar arose in the
bar, which was at the other end of the passage: women
screaming and running hither and thither, loafers
shouting and laughing. Yielding to natural curiosity,
he turned back along this passage and was just in time
to see a stranger sight than he had ever witnessed in all
his six-and-thirty years. There, gesticulating, stammering,
and struggling, was the terrible Indian of the day
before, and, behind him, one hand firmly grasping his
long hair, the other buffeting him liberally over head
and ears, was the landlady&mdash;a sturdy Irishwoman&mdash;who
was &ldquo;helping him into the street,&rdquo; at the same
time expressing her opinion of him with great volubility.
In her wake followed two chamber-maids, each armed
with a mop, and from one of them the traveller learned
that the Indian had already been forbidden to enter
the house on account of his drunken and riotous
behaviour there two days earlier.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_87' name='page_87'></a>87</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;We only keep one manservant, and he&rsquo;s frightened
of him, so Missis had to take him in hand,&rdquo; explained
the girl cheerfully.</p>
<p>The valiant brave made no second attempt to enter
the inn, and stood meekly by his horse till the travellers
were ready, and Head&mdash;with difficulty keeping a
straight face&mdash;bade him lead on. They were soon riding
at a good level pace along the forest track, which, by
its narrowness and few signs of recent use, did not
promise a meeting with many travelling companions.
At first the Indian only answered curtly to the remarks
addressed to him, but, little by little, he forgot the
insult to his dignity and had become quite chatty by
the time they stopped to rest the horses and eat the
dinner which they had brought with them. He said
they would pass no more inns&mdash;no more white habitations
of any sort, in fact&mdash;till they came to the United
States boundary, and but very few then; and no
Indian camps that side of Presque Isle, which was still
forty-five miles distant. From there the travellers
could, if they chose, journey as far as the St. Lawrence
with a party of Crees who would soon be starting
away for the winter hunting, and who would show
them where they could get a boat across the estuary.</p>
<p>They rode another twenty miles before sunset,
and then halted for the night. While the Indian was
making the fire he several times glanced round him
to windward and sniffed the air suspiciously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There will be snow before morning,&rdquo; he said;
and indeed, during the past hour there had been well-nigh
an Arctic chill in the air, though it still wanted
a week or two of the beginning of winter. That snow
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_88' name='page_88'></a>88</span>
was coming was bad hearing; not that two men,
who had often slept practically under water during the
war in Spain, were likely to shirk one night in the
snow; but because they had not troubled to bring
many provisions, being unwilling to hamper themselves
and relying on finding abundance of game in the
forest.</p>
<p>If a heavy snow should come, the chances of killing
anything fit to eat would be diminished tenfold,
for hares, rabbits, and squirrels would stay at home;
and further, the journey towards a district where they
were safe to meet with plenty of animals (elk, caribou,
etc., that had just migrated to the forest from farther
north) would occupy thrice the time they had allowed
for it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You and I must take watch and watch to-night,&rdquo;
said Head to his servant, not unmindful, in face of
new dangers, of the likelihood of their guide&rsquo;s playing
them false. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t want any of this good man&rsquo;s
&lsquo;surprises&rsquo;; if you turn in when you&rsquo;ve had your
supper, I&rsquo;ll call you soon after midnight and we&rsquo;ll
change guard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Immediately after supper the Indian rolled himself
in his blanket and Head was left to amuse himself.
When his man roused him at six the next morning, he
found the ground more than a foot deep in snow, and
the Indian, who was just returning from filling the
breakfast kettle from the stream hard by, greeted him
with the news that the ice was several inches thick.
But, he added, there would be no fear of famine;
they would have sport enough before the day was out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What sport?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_89' name='page_89'></a>89</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Wolves!&rdquo; The Cree smacked his lips as if he
were speaking of a Mansion House banquet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! Then that is what I heard just as I was
falling asleep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Most likely; their track lies all round our camp;
not close, for they feared our fire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is there more snow to come, do you think?&rdquo;
None was falling now.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not unless the wind gets up again. But we ought
soon to be moving; it will be bad going for the
<a name='TC_1'></a><ins class="trchange" title="Added closing quote mark">horses.&rdquo;</ins></p>
<p>The hardy little mustangs seemed not a whit the
worse for their snowy bed, and stepped out bravely
as soon as they were mounted. But Head pulled a
long face as he remembered how little corn he had
brought with him; truly the cobbler&rsquo;s wife was going
the worst shod; he who had control of the entire
military commissariat for that district had left the
food for his men and horses to chance, on a journey
of sixty miles, twenty-five of which had still to be
covered! Of course, the pace they made was wretched,
for the snow was fetlock-deep at the best; and, at the
worst, it had risen to drifts of ten feet, which had
to be dodged or skirted. Three miles an hour was the
utmost that could be expected, making allowances
for everything; and by the time the horses had gone
twelve miles, it was clear that they must have a rest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So our next meal is to be wolf, eh?&rdquo; said Head
as he surveyed a lump of salt beef of which none
would be left when three men with frost-sharpened
appetites had eaten their fill. The Indian nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And they are not far away; I have heard them
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_90' name='page_90'></a>90</span>
for the last hour. The horses can smell them now;
you will find that they will not touch their oats.&rdquo;
This was true; two of the tethered animals crouched
shiveringly, disdaining their food, while the third
strained at his halter as though he meditated flight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What does it matter?&rdquo; said the Cree. &ldquo;We
have but thirteen miles to go; we shall be at our camp
soon after dark, and my people will be as brothers
to you. As for the wolves&mdash;&rdquo; he laughed boastfully&mdash;&ldquo;I
will kill them by the dozen if need be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; we&rsquo;ve seen something of your bravery
before,&rdquo; said the Major in English. He divided the
one remaining loaf and the meat into three equal
parts. &ldquo;You two can do as you like; I shall only
eat half my share now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The servant followed his example, but the Indian
was resolved that the future should take care of itself.
He had scarcely swallowed his last mouthful when he
started up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mount! Quick! They are coming!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then what&rsquo;s the good of mounting, you infernal
coward?&rdquo; said the Major, snatching up his gun.
&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t race wolves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The guide made no answer; but, slipping his
horse&rsquo;s halter, vaulted to his back, and might have
ridden away but that Head turned his gun-barrel
on him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You stay where you are.... Now, Sanders,
we must keep them off the horses if we can. Fire
the moment they show their noses, and trust to their
eating up their brothers while we&mdash;&mdash;<em>Look out!</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>A pack of over forty wolves came yelping through
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_91' name='page_91'></a>91</span>
the trees, with a strange, bouncing motion which
showed that even they were seriously impeded by the
snow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fire; and keep one eye on the redskin,&rdquo; muttered
Head.</p>
<p>A wolf went down before the servant&rsquo;s first barrel
and, from the break in their ranks, several of the others
appeared to be falling on the carcase. A second and
third and fourth fell to the guns; but the wolves had
smelt horse-flesh, and neither noise nor gunpowder
nor dead comrades could keep them from following
up the scent. The two white men reloaded, fired,
and loaded again with the coolness habitual with
soldiers; but it was plain enough that the pack would
not be kept off much longer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid we shall have to give up the horses
after all,&rdquo; said Head, as the foremost wolves bounded
contemptuously past or over the last of their number
that had been shot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you not mount?&rdquo; bawled the Indian in
his ear. Head had forgotten his existence for the
moment. &ldquo;That is the only way to save your horse.
You have had your play; let me show you what the
red man can do.&rdquo; As he finished speaking he methodically
pulled his quiver forward and began to pour
arrows into the howling pack more swiftly than the
eye could follow them, every one of them carrying
death to a wolf.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Up, Sanders, and use your pistols! By Jingo,
that fellow was right!&rdquo; shouted Head as he leapt
into his saddle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see? It is quite easy,&rdquo; remarked the Indian
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_92' name='page_92'></a>92</span>
with as much <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sang-froid</i> as though he were at target-practice.
&ldquo;When I have emptied my quiver they
will all be dead; if not, I have my lance. Don&rsquo;t
waste any more of your powder.&rdquo; And all the while
he went on shooting.</p>
<p>The soldiers could do little but stare at the man&rsquo;s
amazing coolness; he who had writhed and screamed
when attacked by an irate Irishwoman, was now
killing wolves at the rate of about twelve per minute,
and the only time he broke off from his task was to
draw his knife and stab that one of the wolves that was
bold enough to venture a spring at his horse. It was
plain enough that he had known what he was talking
about when he counselled mounting the horses.
Wolves that would tear an unridden horse to shreds
would not dare touch one that was mounted, unless
they were maddened by hunger; and so early in
winter this could hardly be the case.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yah! Now run away, cowards, and tell your
brethren to come,&rdquo; shrieked the Cree, when, without
waiting for his last few shots, the remaining dozen
wolves turned tail and skulked away. Then Head
stretched out his hand and patted the blanketed
shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well done; I did wrong to call you coward.
You shall have double payment when we reach your
camp, and I will make you a present of these two
horses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must have my arrows back, in case of further
accident,&rdquo; said the redskin, making neither much
nor little of his achievement. In a few minutes he
had cut all the barbs from the carcases, and proceeded
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_93' name='page_93'></a>93</span>
to skin the three primest wolves, cut away the fore
and hind quarters, hung the three &ldquo;saddles&rdquo; on his
horse&rsquo;s withers, and remounted. The Cree Indians
and the Eskimos will none of them refuse roast wolf,
and the ribs are considered a special delicacy.</p>
<p>With a little coaxing from the guide the horses now
ate their corn; and, not long after dark, that much
misjudged individual led his employer proudly into
the Indian camp. The chief, very much astonished
at finding a white man able to speak his tongue with
fluency, promised, in return for a ridiculously small
sum of money, to allow the travellers to join his
great hunting party which was to start northwards for
elks, caribous, etc., in a few days&rsquo; time.</p>
<p>During those few days Major Head had an opportunity
of noting various ceremonies peculiar to the
northern Indians, which were quite new to him.
One of these was a dance which signified a loving
farewell between the hunters and the warriors who
remained behind to guard the camp, and was precisely
the same as that which Samuel Hearne saw farther
north-west.<a name='FNanchor_n0001' id='FNanchor_n0001'></a><a href='#Footnote_n0001' class='fnanchor'>[1]</a> In this, the two parties formed into two
single files, and, bow in the left hand and an arrow in
the right, approached each other, walking backwards.
When the lines were almost touching one another, both
turned suddenly, each party starting back with feigned
surprise at seeing the other; then, with astonishing
quickness, transferred the bow to the right hand and
the arrow to the left, in token that their intentions were
strictly friendly.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_94' name='page_94'></a>94</span></div>
<p>The other ceremony was also a dance, the celebrated
snow-shoe dance, which took place when all was ready
for the departure northwards; and in this Head was
especially interested, because he was himself an expert
on &ldquo;shoes.&rdquo; Two or three spears, elaborately
decorated with feathers or other trophies of the
chase, were stuck upright in the snow, and to one of
them a pair of snow-shoes was hung; and, after
prayers and incantations by the old chief, ten mighty
men of the tribe, each carrying his weapons, formed
themselves in a ring round the spears. Waddling,
sliding, dancing, or jumping, these passed round and
round the consecrated shoes till all were satisfied
that the Great Spirit&rsquo;s aid had been enlisted, and
that the ghosts of the animals or birds that they
might kill would never return to vex the slayers.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>
<h3>AMONG THE FUEGIAN INDIANS</h3>
</div>
<p>Tierra Del Fuego&mdash;&ldquo;The Land of Fire,&rdquo; as
Maghelhaens christened it, from the number of
beacons exhibited along its coast&mdash;is the home
of a family of Indians properly known as Pesherahs.
Whence they came no one can tell us, though some
think them to be of Chilean origin; but they are&mdash;and
have been, during the last four centuries&mdash;among the
most degraded savages that the earth holds. This is,
no doubt, partly owing to the barrenness of the archipelago
and the almost animal simplicity of their
lives which is a consequence of it; for though their
brain development is certainly not extraordinary,
it is probably as high as that of many savages who
have yielded with comparative readiness to European
influence.</p>
<p>All sorts of efforts at civilising the Fuegians have
been made by philanthropists, scientists, and missionaries,
but it is to be feared that they have met with
little success. Not the least practical of these was an
experiment made by the late Admiral Fitzroy, inventor
of the nautical barometer that bears his name, and
better known to readers in general as Darwin&rsquo;s friend
and at one time commanding officer.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_96' name='page_96'></a>96</span></div>
<p>From 1826 to 1830 this clever young sailor was in
command of H.M.S. <i>Beagle</i>, which, with H.M.S.
<i>Adventure</i>, was sent on a surveying expedition to
the southern seas. During the early part of this
cruise, while an exploring party was ashore in what
is now called Beagle Channel, a number of Fuegians
took advantage of the absence of the sailors to spring
into their boat and row off with it.</p>
<p>Not wishing to lose the boat, and deeming it advisable
to give the natives a lesson, Commander Fitzroy took
another pinnace ashore and, with half a dozen bluejackets,
made a descent on the nearest encampment,
captured the first family he could lay hands on,
and took them back to the brig to be held in pawn
for the stolen boat. This move, of course, answered its
purpose; the boat was restored and the hostages
liberated. But of these there were three to whom the
commander had taken a special fancy: a stalwart
young fellow of nineteen whom (from the adjacent
mountain which Cook had so named) he had dubbed
&ldquo;York Minster,&rdquo; and a boy and girl of about fourteen.
York and the girl, Fuegia, on being asked if they
would like to come to England, joyfully accepted the
offer; and the other boy was readily exchanged by his
father for a pearl shirt-button.</p>
<p>The enthusiastic young commander brought these
three home with him, endeavoured to teach them
English, and dressed them respectably; and after
he had been ashore for about two years, decided to
take them back to their country as a pattern to their
friends and relations. He engaged a missionary&mdash;a
Mr. Matthews&mdash;and was on the point of chartering a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_97' name='page_97'></a>97</span>
small vessel and taking the natives back at his own
expense, when, to his joy, he heard that his old brig was
to be sent a second time to the Horn and that he, now
gazetted post-captain, was to have command of her.
It was on this voyage that he took with him, as
naturalist, Charles Darwin, a young fellow not long
down from Cambridge.</p>
<p>In December, 1832, the brig anchored in the Bay of
Good Success, and her arrival was hailed by a tatterdemalion
group of Fuegians who piled their fires high
and frantically waved their scanty garments as
though to scare off the intruders. These people of the
eastern side of the island were a far more robust
set than the typical Fuegians of farther west; many of
them were over six feet high, and all boasted some
sort of clothing&mdash;usually a mantle of guanaco (llama)
skin. Fitzroy and other officers went ashore, bearing
presents, at sight of which the savages abandoned
their distrustful and defensive bearing and showed
every willingness to be friendly. Their chief had his
hair confined by a rough head-dress of feathers, and
his coppery face was painted with transverse bars,
after the fashion of the Indians of the North.</p>
<p>The Englishmen distributed pieces of red cloth,
which each recipient immediately tied round his neck.
Thanks for these bounties were offered in a series of
&ldquo;clucks,&rdquo; which a horse would assuredly have translated
as &ldquo;gee-up&rdquo;; and further, by sundry pats
on the breasts of the donors. After Captain Fitzroy
had been thus patted three times by the chief, it
occurred to him to return the compliment, a proceeding
which highly delighted the whole tribe. But the most
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_98' name='page_98'></a>98</span>
exciting scene was when one of the sailors left in
charge of the boat began to sing absently to himself.
In an instant the Indians deserted the group of officers,
rushed madly down the beach again, and almost
grovelled before the singer, considerably to his amazement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right; sing up, my man; let&rsquo;em hear you,&rdquo;
cried Captain Fitzroy encouragingly; for the bashful
performer had stopped somewhat abruptly on finding
himself thus distinguished. &ldquo;Bear a hand, you lads;
he&rsquo;s shy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus urged, the grinning bluejackets struck up a
rousing sea-chorus, the effect whereof was to make
even the important-looking chief stand open-mouthed
and wave his hands in wonder and delight.</p>
<p>As the first meeting with the savages had been so
successful, on his second landing the Captain was
accompanied by York Minster and the other two
natives, Jemmy Button, now a strapping fellow of
eighteen, and Fuegia Basket, already a grown woman,
and betrothed to York. The Indians&rsquo; attitude towards
them was one of curiosity as intelligent as such
people are capable of. They felt their English-made
clothes and compared them half contemptuously with
the bright-buttoned uniforms of the officers, and the
chief, pointing to a few straggling hairs on York
Minster&rsquo;s chin, inquired why he did not shave them off
after the Indian fashion. The colour of their visitors
was the greatest mystery to them. Jemmy and York
were dressed like white men, and had short hair, and yet
were not white. York knew their language and Jemmy
did not. This was very puzzling. Then&mdash;was Jemmy
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_99' name='page_99'></a>99</span>
the same colour &ldquo;all over&rdquo;? The chief made him
strip his sleeve, but while this was being done something
else happened to distract the savages&rsquo; attention.
Mr. Bynoe, the ship&rsquo;s surgeon, had been examining
one or two bad sores on the face of a native, and now
stepped back to a rock-pool to wash his hands.</p>
<p>That a man should dream of washing at all was a
mystery to the Fuegians (in fact, during the whole
of the brig&rsquo;s cruise in these islands the practice never
failed to attract admiration, though it does not seem
to have gained converts), but the doctor had thrown
off his pilot-jacket and rolled up his shirt-sleeves for
the performance. This more than staggered the
beholders, so that Jemmy saw himself rudely neglected;
for the Englishman&rsquo;s arms were a different colour from
that of his hands!</p>
<p>It was the white men&rsquo;s turn to be inspected again.
Everyone, from the Captain to the boat&rsquo;s crew, was
implored to show his arms, and this only led to further
mystification, for while the hands of the officers were
tanned and their arms white, the brown on the seamen
extended to the elbows. A full parliament was at once
held, but the debate had to be abandoned; the matter
was too abstruse for the Fuegian brain.</p>
<p>Mr. Darwin created a diversion by attracting the
Captain&rsquo;s attention to a very tall fellow among the
group; and to settle an argument between them as
to his abnormal height, Fitzroy called to him the tallest
of the boat&rsquo;s crew, and told him to stand back to back
with the rival giant. With the natural vanity of the
savage, the Fuegian seemed to guess in a moment
what was being said about him, and no sooner was he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_100' name='page_100'></a>100</span>
placed back to back with the seaman than he endeavoured,
first to edge himself on to higher ground,
and, failing that, to stand a-tiptoe. When York
Minster explained to him that he was the taller by
two finger-joints, he began to swagger about as if he
had bought the island.</p>
<p>The old chief was very anxious that the three natives
should at once take up their abode with that portion
of the tribe; but neither Jemmy nor Miss Fuegia
could yet make themselves understood; the parents of
all three lived on the other side of the island, and
further, the Captain was not at all satisfied that the
chief&rsquo;s hospitality arose from any higher motive than
that of plunder, if not murder.</p>
<p>With a favouring wind they ran through the Strait
the next day, and once more went ashore. Here
Fitzroy found that his former visit had presumably
been forgotten; for when he led an exploring party
of thirty men into the nearest camp, the natives
armed themselves with slings, stones, and fish-spears,
and assumed altogether a very threatening front.
These folk were the most debased of the islanders;
not one man had a stitch of clothing on him, and whereas
the other natives had shown such terror of the
bluejackets&rsquo; muskets that they would not even lay a
finger on them, these were not even inquisitive as
to the weapons of the white men, and certainly mistook
the amiable demeanour of the strangers for timidity.
They dropped their arms, however, on some offerings of
red ribbon being made.</p>
<p>But possession only whetted greed; and taking up
their arms again, they began one and all to bawl
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_101' name='page_101'></a>101</span>
&ldquo;Yammerskooner,&rdquo; which, York Minster said, meant
&ldquo;give me,&rdquo; but which sounded a great deal more like
&ldquo;your money or your life!&rdquo; The more the sailors
gave, the more did the Indians pester, till, with the
hope of scaring them away, Fitzroy drew his sword
and flourished it round the head of the chief; but he
and those with him laughed jeeringly, as though this
were only child&rsquo;s fooling. Then the Captain, who was
an excellent shot, pointed a pistol at&mdash;or rather half
an inch above&mdash;the head of the noisiest of the party,
and fired.</p>
<p>Every man stared at his neighbour; every man
clapped his hands to his ears and uttered an ejaculation;
but nobody thought of moving. Poor wretches;
they were as ignorant of danger as the wild beasts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No good, Captain Sir,&rdquo; said York Minster. &ldquo;But
you kill one&mdash;then all run.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell them they&rsquo;re likely to get hurt if they go too
far,&rdquo; said the Captain. The interpreter obeyed, but
they showed no more feeling at his remark than fear
of the pistol.</p>
<p>It was growing late; the Englishmen were hungry
and had yet to find a comfortable ground for the
night&rsquo;s bivouac. Fitzroy quietly told his men to draw
off; but at the first movement of retreat, the savages
grew bolder and more menacing. Nothing could be much
more galling to Englishmen than retreat under such
circumstances as these. Here were thirty white men,
all well armed, and the majority of them experienced
fighting-men, turning their backs on less than a hundred
miserable specimens of humanity with scarcely brains
enough to know the use of their own weapons. The
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_102' name='page_102'></a>102</span>
faster the sailors moved, the faster the Indians followed.
To kill one or two of their number would have
been to put the rest to flight; but unless actual
violence should be offered, neither Fitzroy nor any
of his companions were the men to disgrace their flag
by the sort of &ldquo;fighting&rdquo; which has made the Spaniards
and Dutch hated in East and West.</p>
<p>Arrived at a good spot, the Captain called a halt,
and ignoring his persecutors, ordered a large fire to be
made, and posted sentries at various points round the
camp; then told York to try his eloquence with the
natives once more. Meanwhile the stores were unpacked,
and at sight of the strangers eating, a new
begging chorus arose which was fortunately satisfied
by a small distribution of ship&rsquo;s biscuit.</p>
<p>At dark the natives were ordered out of the camp
and warned by York that they must not attempt to
pass the sentries. That lesson was impressed on the
more obstinate by the sailors&rsquo; throwing them &ldquo;neck
and crop&rdquo; beyond the boundary line. This sort of
argument they could understand; and though some
of them loitered round the camp all night, or lit their
own watch-fires close to it, there were no attempts at
trespass.</p>
<p>Young Jemmy Button, on being rallied by the
officers on his disreputable connections, stoutly disowned
them; he belonged to another tribe, he said.
But soon after sunrise several dozen strange men
and women appeared, summoned by the remainder,
and among them were Jemmy&rsquo;s mother and brethren.
Darwin, who witnessed the reunion, says, &ldquo;the meeting
was less interesting than between a horse turned out
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_103' name='page_103'></a>103</span>
into a field and an old companion.&rdquo; But those women
who recognised Fuegia showed themselves very interested
in her toilette.</p>
<p>It was now that the value of Fitzroy&rsquo;s experiment
was to be tested. Matthews, the missionary, asked
to be left behind with three natives while the sailors
continued their coasting trip; and it was plain
enough that York and his bride and Jemmy asked
nothing better than to be allowed to settle among their
own people, from whom they had now been absent four
years. Already Jemmy was recalling his language&mdash;which
was a great mercy for him, for, as Fitzroy had
said earlier, &ldquo;he had forgotten Fuegian and never
more than half learned English, so that he was as
ignorant as a rational being could well be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Captain&rsquo;s surveying expedition lasted for some
days, and when it was finished he ordered the boats
to call at the spot where the missionary had been left,
before they returned to the <i>Beagle</i>.</p>
<p>Mr. Matthews was awaiting them in a terrible plight:
scarcely a rag of clothes on him, hungry, bruised, and
wounded, and with a wretched tale to unfold. Jemmy
had been robbed of everything he possessed; even
York, strong man though he was, had had much ado
to protect himself and his wife, while the missionary,
left to fend for himself, had not dared to sleep during
the whole time. He had been robbed, stoned, threatened
with all manner of violence, and only saved from
death by doling out buttons, studs, or coins which he
had contrived to secrete.</p>
<p>Fitzroy, who knew that these people were not only
ruffians but occasionally cannibals as well, sent the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_104' name='page_104'></a>104</span>
missionary on board again, and was half tempted to
take Jemmy with him also, particularly as the young
man was loud in abuse of his family; but on the whole
he was likely to be safe enough under York&rsquo;s patronage
now that he had nothing left to steal.</p>
<p>The brig made sail farther south, and a month or
so later returned to her old anchorage. Before long a
canoe put off from the shore, and a thin, haggard
savage came paddling out to the vessel&mdash;Jemmy!
Jemmy, without a rag to cover him!</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think, sir, you&rsquo;ll have to take him aboard again,&rdquo;
pleaded young Darwin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It does look like it,&rdquo; said Fitzroy. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid
we&rsquo;ve made a fish out of water of him,&rdquo; and the two
went forward to greet their old friend.</p>
<p>But Jemmy electrified everyone by the statement
that he was perfectly happy, and had only come out to
bring a couple of otter-skins to Lieutenant Sulivan
and Dr. Bynoe&mdash;his favourites among the officers&mdash;and
some neatly-carved arrows for the Captain; and
further, to invite the ship&rsquo;s company ashore to visit
the tribe.</p>
<p>Mr. Button was fed, and loaded with presents; and
later in the day Fitzroy, Sulivan, and Darwin went
ashore. The first thing that was apparent was that
Jemmy had taught the tribe some English words;
the second was that that youth had reasons for not
wishing to rejoin the <i>Beagle</i>. For, pointing to a modest-looking
girl who stood in the background, the old chief
tapped the Captain on the shoulder and observed,
&ldquo;Jemmy&rsquo;s wife; Jemmy&rsquo;s wife,&rdquo; and the whole tribe,
parrot-like, took up the cry.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_105' name='page_105'></a>105</span></div>
<p>Fitzroy never met his protégés again; but, in 1842,
Captain Sulivan, who was cruising off the island, fell
in with a British whaling skipper, and he told him
that his men had seen a native woman who spoke
excellent English. This could have been no other than
Fuegia.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>
<h3>THE END OF THE &ldquo;BLACK HAWK&rdquo; WAR</h3>
</div>
<p>Some allowance ought surely to be made for a
man who is condemned to go through life with
such a name as Muckkertamesheckkerkerk;
and, to do the United States Government justice, the
gentleman so styled seems to have been treated with a
good deal of patience and lenity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Black Hawk&rdquo; (to give him at once the name by
which he is better known in American history) was an
Indian chief who contrived to be as much a thorn
in the flesh of the white rulers of his country as&mdash;let
us say&mdash;some of the Welsh princes were in that of
our Plantagenet kings. He was born in 1767, and
by the time he was fifteen had so distinguished himself
in war and in hunting that he became a recognised
brave of his tribe&mdash;the Sac and Fox. Up till the year
1804 the new republic could afford to ignore the deeds
and misdeeds of this renowned patriot, for he confined
most of his energies to warfare with the Cherokees
and Osages&mdash;sub-tribes of the Iroquois; but, as white
civilisation continued to push westward, it became
necessary either to conciliate or to subdue those who
stood in the way of its progress.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_107' name='page_107'></a>107</span></div>
<p>At first conciliation did not appear difficult. General
Harrison invited Black Hawk&mdash;now a man of four-and-thirty,
and the recognised champion of all the Algonquin
Indian tribes&mdash;to appear at St. Louis, in order to
discuss the question of boundaries, and to enter into a
treaty which would be of mutual benefit. Black Hawk
came, and with him a host of tributary chiefs&mdash;Shawnees,
Blackfeet, Sacs and Foxes, etc.</p>
<p>The American General&rsquo;s proposals were fair and to
the point. The redskins were to renounce all claim to
about seven hundred miles of land east of the Mississippi,
in return for an annual payment of a thousand
dollars. A couple of hundred pounds as rental for a
strip of land some eight hundred miles long sounds
ridiculous enough to us, unless we bear in mind that
the Indians were merely asked to keep to the other
side of the river; they were not giving up towns or
houses or cultivated lands; they were receiving what&mdash;to
them&mdash;meant a very substantial income, in return
for their migrating to far better hunting-grounds
in Iowa and Minnesota. Black Hawk solemnly
agreed to the contract, with&mdash;we must believe&mdash;every
intention of keeping his word.</p>
<p>Unluckily, General Harrison and his officers had
rather lavish notions of hospitality; and when Black
Hawk&rsquo;s decision was made known to the other chiefs,
most of them were a great deal too drunk to know
what they were agreeing to. The money was paid
regularly enough, and, for some few years, whatever
breaches of the treaty there were, were so trifling that
the Government could easily wink at them. Black
Hawk went about his hunting and his civil warfare
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_108' name='page_108'></a>108</span>
and conducted himself as a respectable savage
should.</p>
<p>Then he got into bad hands. As the troubles of our
own armies in India and the Soudan have shown, it is
no uncommon thing to find peaceable men stirred to
fighting frenzy by some maniac who makes it his
business to cause as much strife as possible in the
name of religion. A great prophet had arisen among
the Indians&mdash;a Shawnee, in whose hands poor Black
Hawk was wax; and who gave the redskins no rest
till they crossed the river in a body, and swept eastwards
as far as Michigan, driving the handful of
white settlers back and back to the towns from which
they had come. This was in 1811. In the following
year, now thoroughly persuaded that he and all the
chiefs and all the white subscribers to the treaty
were drunk when it was signed, and that it was no
longer binding, Black Hawk pressed on into Michigan
as far as Detroit. This was more than human patience
could stand; the white citizens turned out, and drove
away the Indians with such slaughter that their leader
was only too glad to draw off. For four years he confined
his attacks to petty farm raids, and, in 1816,
signed another treaty, which was followed by fourteen
years of comparative peace, though Black Hawk
and a few of his supporters refused to retire across the
river again.</p>
<p>By 1830 the States Government, realising its folly
in having allowed any deviation from the strict terms
of the agreement, obliged Black Hawk to sign another,
by which every acre of land east of the river became
white property. It was now that the real trouble began.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_109' name='page_109'></a>109</span>
The Indian chief was growing old, losing his former
promptness of action, and becoming more and more
a slave to the Shawnee prophet&rsquo;s counsels. During the
fourteen years that he had been practically defying
the Government, he and his immediate adherents
had begun to farm a little; and just now their crops
were ripening, and harvest-time was almost due.
When the order came for him to leave the neighbourhood
he lost his head or his temper, refused to stir, and
threatened with death anyone who dared to interfere
with him. A week later he returned from his hunting
to find some white labourers calmly ploughing up his
crops and parcelling out his land. There was a brief
scuffle, and the whites were obliged to flee, and thus
opened the last period of the war.</p>
<p>Knowing that vengeance would be taken, Black
Hawk sent across the river for more warriors, and
prepared to make a decided stand. But instead of the
half-dozen shopkeepers and labourers he had been
prepared to meet, he found himself attacked by a
body of men several hundred strong, well armed, and
many of them mounted. These were the Illinois
militia under General Gaines&mdash;hardy trappers, farmers,
and timber-rafters, whose fathers had fought with and
defeated British regiments. The Indians&rsquo; nerve failed
them, and, after a single deadly volley from the
militia, they fled. But, instead of crossing the river,
they went north, into Wisconsin, where they looked
to find remnants of their tribe who would ally themselves
with them.</p>
<p>During the whole of the next year, and until the
summer of 1832, a very clever guerrilla warfare was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_110' name='page_110'></a>110</span>
carried on by the savages; hundreds of white men
were killed, and scarcely one Indian; nor was there
much in the shape of a pitched battle. It was then
that General Atkinson, an old and experienced fighter
of Indians, was sent to put an end to the whole matter.
Dispatching a small force of light cavalry, under
General Scott, to search the woods, he marched the
bulk of his little army towards the Wisconsin River,
in the hope of eventually surrounding the Indians and
capturing Black Hawk.</p>
<p>His march proved more tedious than he had bargained
for. Nowadays tired New Yorkers and Chicagoites,
with a taste for sport, devote their summer
holidays to shooting over the beautiful Wisconsin
highlands; but in 1832 there were no railways or
palace-like hotels there. Even a farm was a rarity,
and every hill or ravine might conceal a score of
Indian sharpshooters. The whole aspect of the
country was savage, dreary, and forbidding. It
had been the duty of the advance guard to see that
there were no redskins lying in ambush; but General
Atkinson soon began to think that that duty had been
very much neglected, for at almost every mile an
arrow or a bullet came from nowhere, wounding some
man or horse, and in one case killing a Sioux guide.
This kind of thing continued for a couple of days or
more; and Atkinson had begun to say somewhat hard
things of his colleague when one of the scouts rode up
to report a mound of earth which, he said, looked very
much like a grave. Before the day was out, six more
such mounds had been seen by the wayside, and as most
of them were marked by a cross, hastily made with a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_111' name='page_111'></a>111</span>
couple of sticks, it was all too probable that these
were the graves of white men.</p>
<p>The old soldier&rsquo;s mind was soon made up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must get double work out of our horses,
boys,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;there&rsquo;ll be no camping to-night;
I&rsquo;m going to overtake General Scott.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All sorts of possibilities suggested themselves, the
most prominent of which was that they were coming
to a district more thickly populated by Indians,
who had been picking off Scott&rsquo;s men with increasing
rapidity; for the last four graves were ominously close
together. Scouts were doubled and, so far from making
any pretence of a stealthy march, lanterns and torches
were lit, and every hiding-place hurriedly examined.
The night passed without any sign of Indians; but,
soon after daybreak, three or four columns of smoke
were seen rising from behind a hill that lay in the line
of march. Half a dozen scouts galloped forward and
soon disappeared. Atkinson&rsquo;s men closed up, baggage-waggons
were dragged to the centre, and in a moment
everyone was prepared either to charge or to repel a
charge.</p>
<p>In less than five minutes a single horseman appeared
on the top of the hill and clattered down the slope.
Atkinson spurred his horse and hurried to meet the
messenger&mdash;one of the six scouts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; he shouted when he was within earshot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;General Scott&mdash;cholera&mdash;had to give up!&rdquo; was
the cheering intelligence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Forward!&rdquo; shouted Atkinson, and the company
hastened over the hill, at the foot of which a pitiable
state of things awaited them. Soon after the start of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_112' name='page_112'></a>112</span>
Scott&rsquo;s troops, cholera, in its most malignant form,
had broken out among the party. In less than two
days seven men were dead, and now the remainder had
been obliged to abandon their march, for there was
scarcely a trooper of them who was not more or less
afflicted by the horrible malady. As some little
consolation for these tidings, General Scott reported
that he had dislodged a party of Sac and Fox Indians
from a ravine, and that these had fled collectively
towards Bad Axe River.</p>
<p>Leaving behind the few men that he could spare
to guard and nurse the sick, Atkinson hastily drew his
force to a safe distance from the cholera camp, and,
after a few hours&rsquo; rest, marched for the nearest reach
of the river, and along the bank, northwards.</p>
<p>Indian chasing does not permit of lengthy rest; the
cavalry did not stop again till long after nightfall,
and were off again before dawn. That afternoon, as
they came to a wider strip of river, the General realised&mdash;and
not for the first time&mdash;that it is the unexpected
that usually happens. Barely a mile ahead, a schooner,
towed by three cutters, was moving slowly northward.
Atkinson galloped ahead, but before he had overtaken
the vessel the men in the boats had long ceased
rowing, and she was heading more towards the opposite
bank.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who are <em>you</em>?&rdquo; was suddenly shouted from her
after-deck.</p>
<p>&ldquo;General Atkinson. Who are you, and what are
you about here? Seen any Injuns?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The <i>Warrior</i>&mdash;Captain Throckmorton.&mdash;All right,
sir; I&rsquo;m sending a boat ashore for you.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_113' name='page_113'></a>113</span></div>
<p>This was the first that Atkinson had heard of a
river expedition having been sent. He knew Captain
Throckmorton as a very distinguished young officer,
and a clever linguist, master of several native dialects.
While he was speculating as to what had brought the
schooner here, and, further, as to the meaning of a
white, flag-like object which&mdash;as he looked past the
vessel&rsquo;s stern&mdash;he could see waving on the opposite
bank, one of the cutters had pulled ashore and was
waiting for him. A lieutenant met him at the gangway.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cap&rsquo;n&rsquo;s talking to the redskins. Come aft, sir,
please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the waving white thing was explained;
there were Indians on the far bank, seeking, under
cover of the white flag, to parley with the Captain.
Atkinson joined him and, as well as he was able,
followed the dialogue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you want to speak to me, you must send at
least ten of your men aboard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have not so many with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Liar. I saw over a hundred of you a few minutes
ago. Where&rsquo;s your hopeful leader? Where&rsquo;s Black
Hawk?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They were but women and children whom you
saw.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Black Hawk?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are those General Atkinson&rsquo;s warriors on the other
bank?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; interrupted the old soldier explosively;
&ldquo;and I reckon you&rsquo;ll find that out purty soon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is Black Hawk?&rdquo; once more demanded
the Captain.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_114' name='page_114'></a>114</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;He is&mdash;he is&mdash;oh, across the river.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you come aboard if I send you a boat?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I give you fifteen minutes in which to send
away your women. You know what that&mdash;<em>Heads
oh!</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>A flight of arrows had greeted the Captain&rsquo;s last
remark. Happily no one was struck, and the schooner
immediately put into mid-stream again.</p>
<p>Through the thick foliage on the bank, a redskin or a
white feather could be seen every now and then; the
muffled sound of voices could also be heard. Then
another volley of arrows came; and another, and
exclamations from the direction of the boats showed
that two men were wounded. The captain motioned
to the crews to shelter behind the vessel, but still he
gave no order. He had promised a quarter of an hour&rsquo;s
grace, and only five minutes of that time had gone by.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hear that?&rdquo; said Atkinson suddenly; and
Throckmorton nodded. Every man on deck had heard
the click-click of a score or more of gun-hammers being
pulled back.</p>
<p>The crew looked questioningly, but not impatiently,
at their captain; they knew that he would not go
back from his word. There were still seven minutes
to wait.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lie low, all hands,&rdquo; said Throckmorton very
quietly; and as he spoke twenty or more sparks and
flashes showed through the leaves and a shower of
lead flew over their heads. The man at the wheel was
shot in the shoulder; but the Captain sprang back
and had taken the spokes almost before the sailor fell.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_115' name='page_115'></a>115</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Let them go on,&rdquo; he said, looking at his watch
again. &ldquo;Your turn will come, my lads.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Perhaps no other men on the face of the earth,
save those of British extraction, would have stood
by uncomplainingly during those next five minutes
without returning a shot. Every man had a loaded
musket in his hand, except the two or three who were
in attendance on the howitzer, ready at a second&rsquo;s
notice to fire. Another flight of arrows came; then
one more, and the schooner&rsquo;s spars and bulwarks
were bristling with them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two more minutes!&rdquo; said Throckmorton. &ldquo;Look
out; they&rsquo;re firing again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The volley came. One man fell dead, and another
had his hat carried away; but still no one spoke.
Captain Throckmorton beckoned a sailor to him and
bade him take the wheel; and again expectant eyes
were turned on him. Suddenly he returned his watch
to his pocket, and everyone gave a little gasp of relief.
The Captain nodded to the men at the howitzer, and
instantly a shell flew among the trees; and, before the
echo of the report had died away, the sailors&rsquo; muskets
began an incessant fire. Indians appeared from everywhere&mdash;from
tree-branches, grass, sedge, in many cases
only to fall before the steady rain of bullets. Some ran
north, others south, and these latter suddenly found
their retreat cut off by a heavy fire from the other
bank; for Colonel Dodge, whom Atkinson had left in
charge, had only waited for the men on the schooner
to begin firing to get his own carabineers to work.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where can my waggons ford it?&rdquo; asked Atkinson
significantly.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_116' name='page_116'></a>116</span></div>
<p>Captain Throckmorton soon produced a soundings-chart
and showed that, at about a mile higher up,
the waggons could easily cross, now that the tide was
running down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Put me ashore, then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a very few minutes the old fighting-man was in
the saddle again; and, while the baggage was moved on
to the ford, he and a hundred light-armed cowboys
were swimming their horses across the river. The
shelter from which the Indians had fired proved to be
a narrow, copse-like strip which separated the river
from an undulating prairie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There they go, General!&rdquo; cried a young fellow,
Captain Dixon, who rode behind the leader.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay; making for the hills. <em>I</em> know; the same old
plant. We must pretend to be taken in.&mdash;Go on,
Dixon; after &rsquo;em with twenty men.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The General knew well enough, from bygone experience,
that the spot from which the score or so of
redskins were fleeing was probably that at which the
bulk of their army lay <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">perdu</i>, and that they were
merely trying their old trick of getting a pursuing force
between the two halves of their own. He rode steadily
on, and, before he reached the hills, saw that he
had not been mistaken. The fleeing Indians had
suddenly wheeled and were bearing down furiously on
Captain Dixon&rsquo;s few men.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Forward!&rdquo; shouted Atkinson. &ldquo;He can take
good care of himself. We want Black Hawk.... And
here he is, by the living Jingo!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As he spoke, sixty or seventy Indians appeared at
the top of the hill, four of them beautifully mounted;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_117' name='page_117'></a>117</span>
the rest on wrecks of animals that could scarcely be
matched in a Belfast job-yard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fire! A hundred dollars to the man who gets
Black Hawk&mdash;alive or dead,&rdquo; shouted Atkinson as he
drew his horse to one side.</p>
<p>Without drawing bridle, the troop fired and reloaded,
as only men born, reared, and nourished in the saddle
as these were could have done. Three of the well-mounted
Indians, ignoring the volley, rode straight
at the white men, and were followed more hesitatingly
by the rest, with the exception of those killed, and of
the fourth man, evidently&mdash;from his fantastic garb&mdash;the
aged Shawnee prophet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Black Hawk! Black Hawk! Over with him!&rdquo;
roared the excited Yankees, as a splendid-looking old
man, six feet four inches in height, rode fearlessly
at them. Pistol-bullets whizzed round his head, but
he appeared to ignore them and, swinging his war-hatchet,
began to cut a way through the cowboys.
His two well-horsed companions&mdash;his sons&mdash;followed
closely, and in a couple of minutes six of Atkinson&rsquo;s
men were dead. But one glance behind him showed
the chief that he was playing a losing game. General
Atkinson seemed to have surrounded all the rest of the
Indians with his troop, who were hewing them down
right and left. Captain Dixon&rsquo;s men, too, had put to
flight or killed those who had turned on them, and
were now coming to reinforce their comrades.</p>
<p>With a passionate yell of disappointment and
hatred, the chief turned his horse&rsquo;s head in the direction
whither the prophet was already fleeing; and, with
his sons, rode for some distant bluffs. It was all very
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_118' name='page_118'></a>118</span>
well for Atkinson to spur in pursuit, shouting, &ldquo;After
him!&rdquo; The white men&rsquo;s horses had been almost
dead-beat before the flight began, and now could
scarcely move at all; and the General was obliged to
await his baggage-vans for the pitching of his camp,
for at least a few hours.</p>
<p>But, before those few hours were ended, another
party of Indians came riding into view, and, as the
men sprang to their arms, one of Atkinson&rsquo;s Sioux
guides cried jubilantly: &ldquo;They are our brothers! They
are the white chief&rsquo;s brothers also.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The strangers galloped up and showed a goodly
supply of fresh scalps. They had pursued and slaughtered
those of Black Hawk&rsquo;s warriors who could not
escape with him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you catch Black Hawk?&rdquo; asked
Atkinson disgustedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We know where he has gone to hide. What will
the white chief give us for Black Hawk and his sons?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man named a price, and the troop rode off
again. Soon after sunrise they returned, and in their
midst were Black Hawk and his sons. The old chief
was sullenly silent&mdash;a broken man, in fact&mdash;and one is
glad to know that these rough cowboys had it in them
to treat the poor old fellow with the courtesy becoming
his standing among the natives.</p>
<p>With his two sons and seven other braves he was
taken to Fort Monroe and there imprisoned for a
short time; but when the country was once more
quieted, the Government appointed a fresh chief in
his place and he was set at liberty. He died among his
own people six years later.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>
<h3>PERUVIAN INDIANS</h3>
</div>
<p>The history of South America teems with accounts
of arduous marches made by European explorers
through its forests or deserts, across its
mountains or along the banks of its rivers. Some of
these are more widely celebrated than others because
the results were greater; but many minor expeditions&mdash;some
unsuccessful, others serving no practical end&mdash;are
as worthy of remembrance because those who
undertook them went coolly, and with their eyes open,
into all manner of privations or dangers, for the sole
purpose of advancing their country&rsquo;s interests.</p>
<p>Among such secondary enterprises is the journey
made by Lieutenant Smyth and Midshipman Lowe
from Callao to the Amazon, in 1834, an enterprise
which recalls some of the splendidly reckless achievements
of the Spaniards in the first half of the sixteenth
century, or of our own even bolder adventurers in the
second half.</p>
<p>While Captain Fitzroy was still surveying the
southerly parts of the American continent, H.M.S.
<i>Samarang</i>, under Captain Paget, was making a similar
though more rapid cruise right round the peninsula
from La Guayra to the Bay of Panama. As the ship
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_120' name='page_120'></a>120</span>
lay at anchor for observations off the Peruvian coast,
the question was raised as to the possibility of the
Amazon being converted into a water-way between the
Atlantic and the Pacific; and Captain Paget, more in
jest than seriously, asked who would volunteer to go
ashore, cross the Andes, and find the nearest approach
to the main stream of the river. To his amazement,
John Smyth, a junior lieutenant, at once offered,
and so earnestly did he beg to be allowed to go that
the Captain was forced to give way at last. Young
Smyth had a good knowledge of Spanish, and was
known to be courageous and level-headed; but the
difficulty was that not a boat&rsquo;s crew, not a single seaman,
in fact, could be spared to accompany him;
but Smyth insisted that he required no protection,
and only asked leave to take, as companion, his young
cousin, a midshipman named Lowe.</p>
<p>Their knapsacks were soon packed, a cutter took
them ashore, and the crew gave them a parting cheer
as they turned back to the ship. In Callao Smyth
hired five mules, and two Jevero Indians to attend
him as muleteers and guides. As becomes direct
descendants of the Incas, these were fearless, fine-looking
men, industrious and kind-hearted, though by
no means the sort of folk one would like to offend.
They belonged by birth to Ecuador, which is the chief
home of their tribe; but they seemed to know every
yard of the country from Colombia to Chile, and from
the coast to the Brazilian frontier, and, contrary to the
usual custom of their tribe, both spoke Spanish quite
well. One part of their costume which very much
interested the two sailors was a short length of dried
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_121' name='page_121'></a>121</span>
reed which each wore in place of an earring, and fixed
to the end of which was the tooth of a slain enemy.
But this was the only essentially barbarous decoration
they possessed. They were bare-foot and bare-headed,
but wore shirts and trousers like ordinary mortals;
both, too, were Christians.</p>
<p>At first they assuredly did not flatter whatever
vanity the English lads may have possessed, for they
would scarcely believe that such youthful-looking
persons (Smyth was twenty, and Lowe sixteen) could
command the obedience of tried warriors. The
question arose through Luis, the younger guide,
contrasting the weapons of the two. The middy,
after the fashion of the time, wore a dirk, while his
cousin, of course, carried a sword. Was it then the
custom, asked Luis, for the length of an English
warrior&rsquo;s weapon to depend on his years and fighting
experience? With what sort of blade, in that case,
did the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">commandante</i> of a ship fight?</p>
<p>Their opinion improved very much, however, as
time went on and as they found these two lads enduring,
without a murmur, heat and cold and thirst and
fatigue which few white men that they had ever seen
could have borne. Perhaps it should be added that
their experience of white men was limited to the
incorrigible lurchers and beach-combers&mdash;most of
them of Spanish origin&mdash;to be seen anywhere along
the South American coast. By the end of the second
day they had come to feel quite a fatherly affection
for them, so much so that they divulged a secret which,
just at that time, might be worth more than its weight
in gold to the explorers.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_122' name='page_122'></a>122</span></div>
<p>The lieutenant had noticed that, though neither
guide showed any disposition to eat or drink &ldquo;between
meals,&rdquo; they never seemed wearied, nor did they,
when supper-time came round, eat with great appetite;
this was the more surprising since they walked the
greater part of the way, while Smyth and Lowe rode
mule-back. On his making a remark about this,
Filipe, the elder Indian, opened the satchel in which he
carried his various belongings, and displayed a good
stock of leaves and a small tin of quick-lime, saying:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have just eaten your supper, Señor Lieutenante,
and cannot judge; to-morrow I will give you
some of these to try for yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>During the next morning, after a wearisome climb,
Filipe fulfilled his promise; he rolled a few particles
of lime in two or three of the leaves, and, pressing the
whole into globular form, handed it to Smyth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Chew that,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It is <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">coca</i>, and will sustain
you for nearly an hour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Smyth had previously noticed both men stuffing
something into their mouths periodically, but, being
so used to seeing the sailors chew tobacco, he had
never given it a second thought. He chewed lustily
at the little ball for five minutes, but succeeded in
extracting neither taste nor nourishment from it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I should prefer salt pork,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;What
little taste your coca has is beastly; and I am as
hungry as I was before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Patience; you have not chewed it long enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He tried again, and presently the Indian said with a
smile:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Señor?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_123' name='page_123'></a>123</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how it is, but I&rsquo;m losing my hunger.
<em>You</em> try it, Frank.&mdash;Give my friend one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Jevero shook his head doubtfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It must be a little one, then. It is not good for
him. You smoke cigars, and you give some to us;
but you do not give him one. With <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">coca</i> it is the
same.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Smyth continued to chew, and was no longer conscious
either of hunger or fatigue&mdash;for half an hour or
more, when both these mortal ills began to return;
and of course with double acuteness. He remarked
on this to the Indians.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said Luis; &ldquo;now you know how we can
tell the time without a watch, how we know the
number of miles we have walked without counting our
steps. When you feel to want new coca-leaves, thirty-five
minutes have gone by; add the ten minutes
during which you found no effect from them, and you
observe that three-quarters of an hour has expired.
In that time we walk, at the present rate, five miles.&rdquo;
He might have added that, if abused, the coca habit
is as pernicious and as degrading as opium-taking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will be five miles no longer now,&rdquo; said Filipe,
interrupting. &ldquo;Quick; blind the mules, Luis!&rdquo;</p>
<p>They immediately began to bustle about like
seamen in a gale of wind, and, in a few minutes, each
of the five mules had a cloth tied over his eyes. There
was soon no need to ask why. The slope they had
been ascending had become a level strip&mdash;literally a
strip. To the left of them the sailors saw a sheer wall
of rock, rising perhaps a hundred feet, while to the
right, not more than eight feet from it, was the edge
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_124' name='page_124'></a>124</span>
of a precipice. Used as they both were to overcoming
inclinations to giddiness or fear, they shuddered
involuntarily as they cast their eyes over the brink
and found that they could see no bottom to the abyss.
Yet the Jeveros put themselves on the mules&rsquo; outer
side, one leading a string of three, the other two, and
walking heedlessly within a couple of feet of the
precipice.</p>
<p>To add to the gruesomeness of the neighbourhood,
a weird, wailing cry began to rise from the high ledge
above their heads, at the sound of which the Jeveros
crossed themselves and mumbled a prayer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; asked the midshipman, not without
a little touch of awe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Alma perdida!</i>&rdquo; said Luis, reverently lowering his
voice. The words meant &ldquo;a lost soul,&rdquo; but the boy
was unaware of that, and Smyth did not think a
mountain-ledge, such as this, quite the right place to
choose for enlightening him. Used to Spanish and
now to Indian superstition, he guessed&mdash;and rightly&mdash;that
the cry was that of some bird, probably peculiar
to the Andes; and he questioned Filipe, who was
walking at his mule&rsquo;s head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; it is a bird. It passes its time in bewailing
the dead, and the sins which they have committed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will have a chance of bewailing its own death,&rdquo;
said the lieutenant peevishly, &ldquo;as soon as I can get a
shot at it,&rdquo; at which the guides betrayed as much
horror as Smyth himself would have shown had they
proposed using an albatross as a target.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are we going to do if we meet another string
of mules along here?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_125' name='page_125'></a>125</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;One party must lie down and let the other pass
over it,&rdquo; said Filipe indifferently.</p>
<p>By night-time the severe nerve strain of such a
passage was ended, for this ledge at last became a
rock-walled mountain-path sloping at quite an easy
incline. They were no sooner well along this road
the following morning than the guides looked to the
loading of the guns, for they said that in the neighbourhood
they might expect to meet with black Indians,
who were notorious cannibals, and whom it would be
their duty to kill. But it happened that none thought
it worth while to put in an appearance; the &ldquo;cannibals&rdquo;
were probably imaginary, though, of course,
there are blacks&mdash;negroes, not Indians&mdash;settled in
various parts of the Andes, the descendants of the
African slaves introduced by the Spaniards in the
sixteenth century to carry packages of gold or silver
which the Indians could not or would not carry.</p>
<p>At last the most wonderful mountain-range in the
world was crossed. The mules were left at a village,
and the two Jeveros had an opportunity of showing
that they were as expert on the water as on the
mountains. For now they were in Amazonian Peru,
and the Huallaga River had to be descended and
examined before the sailors&rsquo; task was accomplished.
In this more easterly forest district of Peru there are,
at this day, nearly four hundred thousand Indians, and
at that time there were half a million; many of them
very degraded, many more warlike and intelligent
heathens, and others who led quite peaceable lives as
farmers, planters, fishers, or exporters of turtle-oil.</p>
<p>Only once were the sailors in serious danger at the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_126' name='page_126'></a>126</span>
hands of any of these tribes, and that was due not to
themselves or to the natives, but to the Jevero guides,
both of whom had an ineradicable contempt for all
Indian families but their own.</p>
<p>This happened soon after the return journey up the
Huallaga had begun. Smyth had expected such an
occurrence for some time, for he had more than once
been forced to remonstrate with his men for their
quarrelsome or jeering attitude towards Indians whom
they met and talked with, and who would have been
perfectly willing to be friendly and obliging. They
came up with a large canoe containing eight Indians
who were lying in wait for a manatee. Smyth bade
the Jeveros draw up, and entered into conversation
with the hunters, who answered civilly, though not
without some distrust. Luis and Filipe joined in
unasked, and, when it was too late, the lieutenant
perceived that they were &ldquo;chaffing&rdquo; the strangers.
These became more and more angry, and at last refused
to answer Smyth, who thereupon, for peace&rsquo;
sake, told his canoemen to paddle on. They obeyed,
but not without a parting jeer which the Englishmen
did not understand, but which so incensed the Indian
in the bows of the other canoe that he hurled the
harpoon which he was holding straight at Luis.</p>
<p>Luis gave a peculiar twist with his paddle, the canoe
shot sideways, and the weapon passed harmlessly by
him. Filipe picked up the short-barrelled gun that
lay at his feet, but, quick to meet all emergencies,
Smyth drew a pistol and pointed it at him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t drop it before I count three, I shall
fire.&rdquo;</p>

</p>
</div>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_127' name='page_127'></a>127</span></div>
<p>In English, he added quickly to the midshipman,
&ldquo;Cover Luis, if he tries any games.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Filipe dropped the gun with a shame-faced little
laugh, and Luis showed no disposition either to take
revenge for the harpoon, or to back up his friend
against their employer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give way, as hard as you can; both of you,&rdquo; said
the lieutenant, watching, with no little concern, the
harpoons which were being held in readiness to throw
at his canoe. Perhaps one bullet from his gun might
have put the whole boat&rsquo;s crew to flight, but he had the
love of fair play and reluctance to kill which has distinguished
the majority of British explorers, whether
renowned or obscure. He put his pride in his pocket
and frankly ran away.</p>
<p>Strangely enough, neither of the Jeveros ever showed
any animosity towards him for thus siding with the
enemy. When, at length, the parting time came, both
pressed keepsakes on the young officers, and then surprised
them by holding them by the hands and crying
over them like a pair of women.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>
<h3>THE CARIBS OF GUATEMALA</h3>
</div>
<p>In 1839, curious as to the rumours of general
anarchy prevailing throughout most of the Central
American countries, the United States Government
sent a young Foreign Office official&mdash;Mr. John
Lloyd Stephens&mdash;to find out the truth of the matter.
At first glance there seems nothing specially alarming
or hazardous about such a mission, nor would there be
nowadays; but, at the date of which we are speaking,
there were no means of rapid communication between
the towns, and many of the roads, rivers, and forest
or mountain tracks were in the hands of strong parties
of Carib and Mosquito Indians, Zambos, and Mestizos
(white and Indian half-bloods), who would have no
more respect for an agent of the American Government
than for the colonists of their own country, against
whom many of them were uniting their forces.</p>
<p>Under the circumstances, Mr. Stephens thought it
wisest to land at Belize, and learn from the English
officials there the best plan to pursue. British Honduras
at that time was not strictly a Crown Colony, but
was governed by the executive in Jamaica. The
commanding officer of the garrison, Colonel McDonald,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_129' name='page_129'></a>129</span>
received him with great geniality, and entertained him
for a couple of days. But he could promise him no
material help, he said, when once he was off British
soil; he had no authority even to lend him a boat or
launch, and dared not take upon himself to send an
armed escort beyond the frontier.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is a Guatemala steamer starting up the
Belize river to-morrow night,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I will send
down and book you a passage. After you land you
must not rely on us&rdquo;&mdash;the Colonel laughed&mdash;&ldquo;in
our official capacity, that is to say. Of course, some
of the staff are often up country after game, and
if we should happen to find you in a tight corner on
somebody else&rsquo;s ground, we couldn&rsquo;t, as private
individuals, leave you in the lurch. You&rsquo;ve got a
nasty job; Guatemala and Honduras are both more
or less in rebellion; so&rsquo;s Mexico for that matter; and
the Indians are plundering Government and revolutionaries
alike. We&rsquo;ve had a little trouble of our own
with the Caribs; you&rsquo;ll probably meet some of our
firing-parties, any of whom will guarantee you protection
as long as you&rsquo;re our side of the boundary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next evening, Mr. Stephens, accompanied by his
secretary, Mr. Catherwood, went on board the little
steamer&mdash;a boat which an American or English owner
would send round the world with a ship&rsquo;s company of
six, but which, here, was manned by no less than
twenty Mestizos, an English engineer, and a Spanish
skipper. The only other passenger was a young Irish
Franciscan, who proved very jovial company, and who
professed to regard the Indian risings as a mere idle
scare. He, too, was going into the first native territory
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_130' name='page_130'></a>130</span>
through which the travellers must pass, and offered
himself as their guide thus far.</p>
<p>They could not have had a better, for his &ldquo;cloth&rdquo;
was of more use to them than a small escort might
have been. Soon after leaving the steamer they came
to the first of the Carib camps. The Irishman baptised
all the babies in the place, good-humouredly &ldquo;chaffed&rdquo;
the warriors over their unwisdom in taking part in
white men&rsquo;s squabbles, procured a supply of provisions
for himself and his companions, and all three
set off across the boundary into the more dangerous
territory.</p>
<p>They should by right have reached a Spanish village
that night, where they would have been able to obtain
horses; but a storm came on, and there was nothing
for it but to wait on the plain till it was over. A question
arose as to shelter and fuel, and this was solved
by their seeing a sheep-fold in the distance. They
came up to it and found it untenanted; there was a
hut big enough for three persons to sit in, but too small
for even one to lie in. For a fire, they broke down
some of the rails of the fold, from which they cut
kindling wood, and soon had a cosy blaze which defied
the rain; they ate their supper and slept on the floor
of the hut, huddled together.</p>
<p>In the morning they were awakened by a loud
chattering of men, and Stephens, who was nearest the
door, found himself being dragged forcibly into the
open, while he was rubbing his eyes and trying to
remember where he was. Catherwood sprang out
after him, pistol in hand, only to be overpowered and
relieved of it by a crowd of Caribs.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_131' name='page_131'></a>131</span></div>
<p>But, at sight of the friar, the Indians hesitated
and became less noisy. He spoke to them in their own
language, and demanded to know the cause of this
violence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These men have broken up and burnt our sheep-fold,&rdquo;
exclaimed one of the Caribs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, well; leave go and I&rsquo;ll explain. Give that
gentleman his pistol back; he doesn&rsquo;t want to hurt
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell them we&rsquo;ll pay for our night&rsquo;s lodging,&rdquo; added
Stephens.</p>
<p>An explanation was offered and accepted, as were
five dollars (about the value of the whole enclosure
in a country where wood was plentiful) from the
Americans; and the mollified Caribs led the way to
their camp, gave the strangers a good breakfast, and
put them on their road for the Spanish village. There
they found everything quiet and orderly, though
reports were rife as to terrible doings farther west;
the Irishman obtained two good horses for his friends
and bade them good-bye, as their ways divided here.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re on our own resources now, and no mistake,&rdquo;
said Stephens when, coming to the end of the plain,
they found themselves in the hilly district which grows
higher and higher till it becomes the Central Guatemala
Range, 13,000 feet high. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s have a look at the
chart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Colonel McDonald had warned them of the mountains,
and had given them a plan showing one or two
deep river valleys, here and in Salvador, by following
which they could reach the Pacific coast without any
climbing that a horse could not manage. Upon this
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_132' name='page_132'></a>132</span>
an Indian village was marked at a distance of about
six miles from where they now were; and they might
expect to reach it easily by nightfall, after allowing
themselves ample time for making notes of the country
by the way. They were tolerably sure of a civil
reception and a night&rsquo;s lodging, for their thoughtful
Irish friend had given them a letter of introduction
to the resident Spanish padre of the place.</p>
<p>They made very few notes, for they had no fancy
for a second night over a fire of palings; another
storm was threatening, and they spurred for the village
without further delay, arriving at the same time as the
rain. It was just at the end of the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">invierno</i>, or wet
season, which consists, in Central America, of lengthy
thunderstorms at very irregular intervals. The priest
happened to be absent, but letters of recommendation
were superfluous here; the travellers had landed on a
tribe of Caribs as different from the others as yeoman-farmers
are from gypsies. The others had been one
part shepherds and nine parts brigands; these were the
agricultural Guatemalans, descendants of the most
highly civilised of the ancient Indians, whom&mdash;by
reason of their very civilisation&mdash;Cortez could easily
subdue in war, while the other tribes rendered his
march through the country anything but safe or
triumphant. Their inoffensive disposition made the
Spaniards treat them rather as protégés than as
victims.</p>
<p>The only difficulty that presented itself was that few
of the inhabitants spoke any language but their own,
for the tribe had, for four centuries, resisted all attempts
to force a new language or new laws upon them;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_133' name='page_133'></a>133</span>
even their Christianity was but a hundred years old.
They entertained the visitors well, but could give them
no information as to the state of the country; they
were not interested in the doings of the outer world;
they cultivated their cochineal insects, grew their coffee,
tended their cattle, and minded their own business.
They gave the Americans an unoccupied hut, brought
them a generous supply of meat, wine, and cakes, and
left them to amuse themselves for the night, with
instructions to ring if they wanted anything; the
ringing, by the way, to be performed by beating a
drum which they hung outside the hut door.</p>
<p>Just before it was light, Stephens waked to hear a
low cry from his friend. He sat up and struck a light.
Catherwood was lying with his knees drawn up, hands
clenched, and eyes staring, and, in reply to the other&rsquo;s
questionings, answered only in an incoherent babble.
Stephens crossed over to him and saw that his teeth
were chattering and his face almost scarlet; there was
no doubt as to his condition; he was in a burning
fever. Nothing could have been more unlucky. He
had brought the young fellow with him purely on his
own account, and unauthorised by his department.
He was not in Government service, but merely a
personal friend whom Stephens&rsquo; private means enabled
him to keep in constant employment as amanuensis;
therefore, to lose several days, or weeks, nursing him,
at such a time, would be to bring himself into serious
disgrace with the ministry. Yet how could he leave
him in an Indian camp, to the tender mercies of some
mad witch-doctor, who would charm and physic him
to death with the most generous intentions?</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_134' name='page_134'></a>134</span></div>
<p>He paced up and down for a while, and, at daylight,
went out into the open, forced by his own ignorance
of medicine, and his anxiety for his friend&rsquo;s safety, to
stoop to ask advice of a people whom his American
upbringing had taught him to despise. And it was
just possible that the Spanish padre might have returned
by now, and he would be sure to possess some
knowledge of drugs and minor surgery. In the village
street he met the chief, one of the few natives who
spoke Spanish.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will call the physician of the tribe,&rdquo; he said,
when Stephens, learning to his dismay that the priest
was not expected till night-time, had communicated
his difficulty.</p>
<p>The native doctor was a little old man who had no
small opinion of his own importance, and was as
contemptuously ignorant of Spanish as the Yankee
was of Huaxtecan and Cariban. He passed his hand
over the patient&rsquo;s brow, breathed on him, muttered
incantations, and then walked round the hut about a
dozen times, solemnly talking to himself, till Stephens
could scarcely resist the temptation to give him a lift
into the street with his foot. After a time the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">piache</i>,
doctor, conjurer, or whatever he called himself, took
out two powders from his girdle, poured water on them,
sipped the drink, breathed and mumbled over it,
opened the sufferer&rsquo;s mouth, and poured it down his
throat before the spectator could make up his mind
whether to interfere or no. Then the old image
strutted out of the hut, as proud as Punch.</p>
<p>This was all very well, but Stephens&rsquo; mind was ill
at ease. He followed the man of medicine into the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_135' name='page_135'></a>135</span>
street, and found the chief waiting modestly but
expectantly outside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ask him what he has given my friend,&rdquo; he said,
curtly. The chief bowed, but shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These are mysteries into which I may not inquire.
The physician&rsquo;s secrets are sacred. You may rest
assured that the young white man will soon be well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Of course, Stephens did anything but rest assured
of this. He turned into the hut again, and lo! Catherwood
was sleeping as peacefully as a child, with no
sign of indisposition except the flush on his face. The
chief peeped in apologetically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He says that the sick señor will be well enough to
travel by midday,&rdquo; he whispered. It was now four
o&rsquo;clock; Stephens ate some breakfast fretfully,
looked at the patient, walked about the village, and
sought to kill time as best he could. Every time he
re-entered the hut, Catherwood&rsquo;s temperature was
less high; and, about the middle of the day, he awoke
of his own accord, ravenous for some breakfast. The
old medicine-man had known his business; had
administered two, out of the thousand and two, healing
drugs which the American forests and valleys produce&mdash;probably
quinine and some preparation of poppy&mdash;and
had nipped in the bud what was doubtless an
attack of malarial fever.</p>
<p>Catherwood paid his doctor&rsquo;s bill by the gift of a
four-bladed pen-knife, his friend forced a similar present
on the chief, and early in the afternoon they rode
away about their business. The next few weeks were
passed in hurried journeys from town to town, in false
alarms, in being potted at by revolutionaries, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_136' name='page_136'></a>136</span>
humbugged by officials; and by the time they had
crossed once more to the Bay of Honduras and the
Guatemala coast, they had found out all that there
was to learn.</p>
<p>About a mile from the British boundary they encountered
their most exciting adventure. Outside a
Carib village were a dozen Indians and Mestizos, all
armed with guns, and in heated argument with five
young men, who were obviously British officers in
mufti; these also had guns, and two of them carried
well-filled game-bags.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You intend to keep us here? It will be the worse
for you if you try it,&rdquo; the eldest of the white men was
saying in Spanish.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Unless you give us what we ask,&rdquo; replied a Mestizo
insolently. &ldquo;You have no right to be over the border.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Americans pulled up their horses, and Stephens
drew a pistol.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to be in this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then pray begin by putting that pistol out of the
way, there&rsquo;s a good fellow,&rdquo; said Major Walrond, the
young man who had spoken to the half-caste. &ldquo;We
shall be very glad if you&rsquo;ll back us up. We want to get
out of it without firing on them if we can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the row?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;These Mestizos belong to the rebels, and are recruiting
among the Indians; promising them all sorts
of plunder, no doubt, and they rather think of practising
on us for a start; want us to empty our pockets and
game-bags, and give up our guns and ammunition.
Look out, you fellows.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Seeing a reinforcement for the white men, yet not
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_137' name='page_137'></a>137</span>
one that need be feared so far as they could see, the
ruffians were becoming impatient, and one or two had
cocked their guns.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ride &rsquo;em down; use your whips, but for goodness&rsquo;
sake don&rsquo;t fire a shot while we&rsquo;re on this side of the
boundary,&rdquo; said the senior officer hurriedly. &ldquo;Bravo,
Spencer; over with him&rdquo;; for a subaltern had
seized the rifle of one of the half-breeds and was
wrenching it out of his hands. &ldquo;Thank you, Mr.
Stephens.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The last remark was occasioned by the American&rsquo;s
felling with his pistol-stock an Indian who was taking
aim at the Major. Then the white men began to hit
out, shoulder to shoulder. The Indians were quickly
overpowered, for they were more than half afraid of
the guns they held, and, on these being wrested from
them, fled to the nearest ravine. But the Mestizos
were more of a handful. There had been five of them
to begin with; the subaltern had disarmed one, and
he had fled; Major Walrond had just knocked another
down with his fist, and he lay unconscious; but the
other three, artful enough to reflect that even if their
opponents decided to fire on them, their guns were only
charged with bird-shot, harmless at any appreciable
distance, were running away with the evident intention
of using their own ball-cartridges from some point
of vantage.</p>
<p>Stephens&rsquo; matter-of-fact Yankee way of looking at
things now became a valuable asset.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>We&rsquo;re</em> no British subjects,&rdquo; he said hurriedly,
&ldquo;and you&rsquo;ll not be to blame if we fire on these chaps&rdquo;;
and, pistol in hand, he spurred after one fugitive while
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_138' name='page_138'></a>138</span>
Catherwood pursued a second. The third fired at
Catherwood, the bullet carrying away his hat, but one
of the subalterns was on him before he could load
again, wrenched the rifle out of his hands, and gave him
a complimentary tap on the head with the butt
thereof. The other two, seeing that the horsemen at
least would have no scruple about using firearms,
stopped when called upon to do so, and sullenly gave
up their guns.</p>
<p>But that mile back to British territory seemed a
most amazingly long one. The Carib fugitives had
alarmed the neighbourhood, and knots of Indians were
gathering, armed with bows and arrows, which they
seemed desirous of using on the white men, for the two
or three venomous lies circulated all in a moment by
the Mestizos had soon swelled to two or three dozen;
and to the Caribs, the opportune arrival of the two
men on horseback was part of a deep-laid plot against
their liberties.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall we ride in and disperse them?&rdquo; suggested
Catherwood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better not; it&rsquo;ll only make matters worse,&rdquo; said
one of the Englishmen gloomily. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ll let go with
their bows if you do. I think we look fools enough as
it is, sneaking along like this; better not make it any
worse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; we can&rsquo;t afford to have Guatemala declaring
war against Great Britain,&rdquo; laughed Walrond. &ldquo;If
they attempt to shoot we must let them have it; but
it mustn&rsquo;t be said that we fired first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was a queer procession; every man felt that he
was cutting a hang-dog figure; he was not afraid of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_139' name='page_139'></a>139</span>
an arrow, but he was mortally afraid of looking ridiculous.
All knew, too, that if serious trouble arose, the
commanding officer would forbid their crossing the
frontier any more, and there was no shooting to be had
on their own side of it that could compare with that
here.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, my chickens,&rdquo; muttered Walrond at
last; &ldquo;if you follow us just fifty yards farther, we
may be able to deal with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The fifty yards were covered; the white men were
on their own ground again, but still the Indians&mdash;proudly
indifferent to frontiers other than those recognised
by their own tribe&mdash;followed at a distance of
about forty paces, debating their tactics in low tones,
and by no means unwilling to make a rush for the
Englishmen and rob them of their guns.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now let&rsquo;s tickle them a little,&rdquo; said Major Walrond;
and he turned sharply and sent a charge of
small shot among the Indians. &ldquo;Down, quick;
&rsquo;ware arrows.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two horsemen jumped out of their stirrups and
fell on the grass, and the little shower of arrows passed
harmlessly over the heads of all. The other four
officers fired in quick succession. This was too much
for the Caribs, many of whom were peppered right
painfully; and, with no further pretence at shooting,
they turned and fled towards their village, leaving the
white men masters of the field.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>
<h3>A PRINCE&rsquo;S ADVENTURES IN BRAZIL</h3>
</div>
<p>Prince Adalbert of Prussia, a nephew of
Friedrich Wilhelm III, is less remembered as
a traveller than as a frequent visitor to this
country, and one who sought to build up a German
navy that should, in time, be an exact copy of our
own. Yet, in his younger days, before he took seriously
to sailoring, he led a restless, wandering life, and, in
the course of about eighteen years, contrived to see
almost every country in the world.</p>
<p>In 1842, when he was a little over thirty, he landed
at Parahiba, in Northern Brazil, with a small suite of
Prussian officers, determined to make a cross-country
journey to the Andes and back. Needless to say, such
a march promised no small amount of excitement and
danger; for European settlements were few and far
between, and the greater part of the inhabited regions
were in the hands of Caribs and Guaranis, who, even
where they were not savage and bloodthirsty, were
usually so jealous of the intrusion of white men that
they would offer every hindrance to their progress
through the country.</p>
<p>The initial difficulty was the not uncommon one of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_141' name='page_141'></a>141</span>
obtaining guides. Guides by the score&mdash;Indian, half-blood,
Spanish and Italian&mdash;were ready enough to
show the way to Caxias, two hundred and fifty miles
distant; but the Prince happened to have an excellent
chart of the country as far as even three hundred miles
beyond that (to the other side of the Para River). But
beyond the river no one had been or had any intention
of going, for fear of the Indians, who were popularly
supposed to number cannibalism among their other
little eccentricities. Passably good horses, however,
were not hard to come by, and the little cavalcade
crossed the first five or six hundred miles of plain and
forest without mishap, and without seeing any other
Indians than those who were mildly and agriculturally
disposed.</p>
<p>But now they came to what looked like an untouched
and absolutely impenetrable forest, where
neither man nor horses could move unless a path was
first cut; and to render this gloomy neighbourhood a
little more uninviting, there appeared to be no dearth
of jaguars, wild cats, and boa-constrictors. Several
of the officers separated and, for a whole day, rode in
every direction, exploring every possible curve and
opening that might be the beginning of a road; losing
themselves and each other a score of times. But at
sundown, when all met at a prearranged spot, Count
Oriolla&mdash;the last to arrive&mdash;triumphantly announced
that he had found a winding path that showed signs of
rare but comparatively recent use. He had traced this
for a good ten miles, and it still promised to remain
open and to lead &ldquo;somewhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To a band of men who were young, strong, well
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_142' name='page_142'></a>142</span>
armed, and romantically inclined, the prospect offered
by this mysterious path was a delightful one, and by
daybreak everyone was waiting and anxious to continue
the journey. Count Oriolla led the way through
various palm clumps and then alongside a wall of
forest where every tree seemed to be linked inextricably
to its neighbour by creepers and lianas; and,
after some five miles of this, to a little wedge-like
opening which continued in a sharp backward turn,
and which no one but himself had noticed on the
preceding day. For just a few yards this was so narrow
that the horses could only move in single file, but it
very quickly widened to the breadth of an ordinary
country lane. Close examination by the scientist of
the party showed that it was a path chiefly of Nature&rsquo;s
making; probably a dried-up watercourse which had
been used by men and cattle at sufficiently frequent
intervals to prevent the saplings, suckers, and undergrowth
from becoming a serious obstruction.</p>
<p>Travelling very much at their ease, the Prince and
his companions followed this road for about fifteen
miles before stopping for the midday meal and siesta.
In consequence of the great heat they usually all
rested from twelve till four; but to-day Count Oriolla
and Captain Bromberg preferred to walk on for a mile
or two as soon as they had lunched, in order to see
what possibilities the neighbourhood offered in the
way of game, fruit, and water. A few hundred yards
from the camp they came to a veritable cherry orchard
on a small scale; a grove of tall trees laden with small
black fruit and having leaves and bark precisely the
same as those of the European cherry. The fruit was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_143' name='page_143'></a>143</span>
the &ldquo;jabuticabas,&rdquo; or Brazilian cherry; the two
young men tasted some &ldquo;windfalls,&rdquo; and these were
so promising that the Count urged his more active
companion to climb one of the trunks and shake down
a good supply.</p>
<p>For a sailor this was no difficulty; and Captain
Bromberg was soon in the fork of a tree, rocking the
branches vigorously, while the Count stowed the
falling fruit in a small game-bag. Presently the Captain
happened to peer down from his perch, and then, to his
bewilderment, he saw that a third person had appeared
on the scene. The Count was still on his knees, diligently
filling the bag; while, unperceived by him, a
tall Indian, armed with a spear, bow, and quiver,
stood near him as motionless as a statue.</p>
<p>Bromberg at once swung himself down and dropped
beside his friend, so suddenly that the Count sprang
up in alarm, though the Indian betrayed no shadow of
surprise. The Count, turning his head and finding
himself face to face with a Carib, started back with a
cry of astonishment and fumbled in his pocket for
the pistol which he usually carried there; but the
stranger&rsquo;s demeanour was so mild and amiable, that
he at once felt ashamed of himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you speak to him in Spanish?&rdquo; said
Bromberg; &ldquo;no doubt he would understand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Count, himself half Spanish, spoke civilly to the
Carib, who at once answered in that tongue, at the
same time turning his spear-point to the ground in
token of peace. He pointed to the end of the grove
of fruit trees.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is where I live, gentlemen&rdquo;; and for the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_144' name='page_144'></a>144</span>
first time they noticed a thin column of smoke
rising from a hut or tent a couple of hundred yards
away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is there an Indian village here then?&rdquo; asked the
Count.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nearly a mile farther on; I and my parents keep
an inn outside it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The outlook seemed promising, and the Count at
once asked as to the likelihood of their finding suitable
guides.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You want to go by way of Santaren? Yes; any
of us will guide you as far as there, or even to the
Madeira River. But we should not choose to go any
farther, for we are ill friends with the Guaranis just
now; nor would you do well to venture far up the
Amazon; between Indians, reptiles, and <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">tigres</i>, your
lives would never be safe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two officers laughed; and the Count, giving
their new acquaintance a drop of brandy from his
flask in token of good will, easily persuaded him to
return with them to the spot where they had left their
companions.</p>
<p>The Prince at once asked to be conducted to the
village. This consisted of a very picturesque street of
palm-thatched huts, whose owners looked cleaner,
more robust, and more thriving than any Indians
Prince Adalbert had seen. A deputation, consisting of
two chiefs and a native Catholic priest, came to bid
the new-comers welcome, and begged them to accept
the hospitality of the village for as long as it might suit
them. They confirmed what the other Indian had
said: the way was safe enough and agreeable enough
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_145' name='page_145'></a>145</span>
as far as the confluence of the Amazon and Madeira,
but no farther.</p>
<p>On learning that the white men would pass that
night in the village, everyone was resolved to make
the stay an entertaining one. The visitors were shown
the parish church, school, stores, etc., and eventually
led to the older chief&rsquo;s house for an elaborate meal of
fish, turtle-eggs, mushrooms, venison, partridges, and
stewed monkey, with fruit jellies, cakes, and native
beer. The hut was neatly furnished with cane-seated
benches or lounges; and&mdash;not always to the guests&rsquo;
greater comfort&mdash;a puma, various snakes, a couple of
monkeys, and three parrots, all very tame, wandered
about the place at will.</p>
<p>Soon after supper, while Prince Adalbert smoked with
the chiefs and the padre, he unconsciously committed
a very serious breach of local etiquette. Attracted by
the great size and artistic workmanship of two bows
that stood against the wall close by him, he leant forward
and took up one to examine it more closely.
Immediately a heart-rending scream rose from the only
woman present&mdash;the cacique&rsquo;s widowed mother&mdash;who,
springing forward, snatched the weapon from
the stranger&rsquo;s hand and replaced it with great care and
reverence.</p>
<p>The courtier-instinct of the Prussian officers was
naturally scandalised, the cacique remained perfectly
still, though he looked very uncomfortable, and said
something in dialect to his mother that appeared to
be a gentle reproach; while the Indian padre, whose
education had brought him more in touch with white
men and their notions of hospitality, hastened politely
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_146' name='page_146'></a>146</span>
to explain and apologise. The bows, he said, were the
last weapons used by the woman&rsquo;s late husband, and
it was the custom of the tribe to regard such things as
extremely sacred; no one but the deceased&rsquo;s widow
or eldest son might so much as touch them or stand
within a pace of them. The Prince was, of course, too
much a man of the world to feel any annoyance, and
quickly put his entertainers at their ease again by expressing
keen interest in the customs peculiar to the
Caribs; and this led to the cacique&rsquo;s inviting him to
witness a dance which was being arranged in his
honour. He led the way to the public square or
<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">plaza</i>, which was now illuminated by a symmetrical
arrangement of torches and a huge bonfire. As soon
as all were seated under a canopy, the cacique struck
a gong, and, from every corner of the square, the
young men of the tribe appeared, each armed with a
blunted spear and a round wooden shield; and, at a
second beat of the gong, all these began an awkward,
waddling march round and round the fire. This had
gone on for some minutes when, with a roar that was a
splendid imitation of a bull&rsquo;s bellowing, a man sprang
up from the ground and, with head down, pretended
to run at full charge through the procession. The
march stopped instantly, every man turned his spear
on the disturber, and then followed a really admirable
pantomime of a bull-fight, which ended in the vanquishing
and pretended death of the &ldquo;bull.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the morning the Prussians sought to press
various gifts on the hospitable Indians; but they were
only received under protest and on condition of the
visitors accepting others in return; moreover, the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_147' name='page_147'></a>147</span>
cacique appointed five mounted men to act as guides
as far as the river; and these, he said, were on no
account to accept any payment beyond their daily
rations.</p>
<p>A march of something like four hundred miles now
lay before the travellers, and this was accomplished,
by easy stages, within about a fortnight. When once
the river was in sight the Indians did not, as the Prince
had expected, promptly desert; nevertheless, they reground
their knives and the points of their spears and
arrows as though they anticipated an attack at any
moment. But no other Indians were sighted for a
while; the ford of the Madeira marked on the chart
was found, and the explorers crossed the river in comfort
and bade good-bye to the honest fellows who had
guided them so far and so faithfully.</p>
<p>Now came a temporary break in the forest land;
and for several miles the road was a mere sand-strip,
like a towpath, running between the Amazon and some
low, marshy ground. No one was sorry to escape
from this district to the higher and more wooded lands
again, for not only do such marshes breed all kinds of
fever, but they are the chosen lurking-places of crocodiles,
water-serpents, and other abominations.</p>
<p>On the third afternoon of the new march, Count
Oriolla noticed, as they entered upon more forest land,
that dark-skinned figures continually flitted among the
trees, as though someone were spying on or keeping up
with the horsemen. He reported this, and the Prince
gave orders for all to draw more together and to have
their weapons ready to hand. At every step, too, the
track betrayed more and more signs of recent use by
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_148' name='page_148'></a>148</span>
horses and cattle; and, from the top of the next hill,
a haze like the smoke from dozens of houses was
visible.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are those?&rdquo; asked the Prince as he pointed
to some dark objects moving on the surface of the
water a long way ahead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Canoes, <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Hoheit</i>; and Indians in them,&rdquo; promptly
answered the naval captain, more accustomed than
the rest to long-distance gazing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, well; let us ride on. They probably intend
us no harm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just then a valet, who was riding a little to the rear,
hurried forward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your Highness may perceive that we are being
followed,&rdquo; he said; and pointed behind him to a group
of thirty Indians of some other tribe than the Caribs,
who were moving along on foot at a steady double;
and among the trees closer at hand several more could
be seen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better to ignore them for the present,&rdquo; said the
Prince. &ldquo;Evidently the village is not far away; time
enough to stop when we come to it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This looks like an ambuscade,&rdquo; muttered Oriolla to
the man riding next him. They had come almost to
the end of the little patch of forest, and, beyond the
last belt of trees, the heads and forefeet of several
horses drawn up in line could be seen. The words were
hardly out of his mouth when, howling at the top of
their voices, two dozen men shot out from the cover
indicated and rode at full speed towards the new-comers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pistols out; but let no one fire unless I give the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_149' name='page_149'></a>149</span>
word,&rdquo; shouted the Prince. &ldquo;Ha! Here come the
others from behind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The second lot of Indians had increased their pace,
and the Prussians saw themselves about to be hemmed
between two little forces of yelling savages. Within a
few yards, both parties of redskins halted and either
brandished their axes or fitted arrows to their bows.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you want?&rdquo; shouted the Prince in
Spanish.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are our prisoners; you must come with us
to our camp,&rdquo; said a young Indian, advancing his
horse a foot or two. &ldquo;Give up your arms.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Prince looked round at his followers. They only
numbered thirteen, all told, five of whom had never
been under fire in their lives. Then he said resolutely:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly we will come with you; but we shall not
give up our arms; and if any violence is attempted, I
warn you that we shall fire on you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>None of the Indians carried guns, and for that reason
the Prince had more faith in the efficacy of his threat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said the leader of the mounted Indians.
&ldquo;Follow us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was but a short distance to the village or camp or
<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">tolderia</i>; and, at the entrance to it, the Guaranis (for
to that tribe they belonged) dismounted, and each of
the white men found his bridle seized by an Indian.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is your chief? Where is your cacique?&rdquo;
demanded Prince Adalbert impatiently.</p>
<p>His captors pointed to a young man who, accompanied
by another much older, had just appeared from
the largest of the huts and was coming towards them.
The young chief proved to be a very mild-mannered
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_150' name='page_150'></a>150</span>
person. He said half apologetically that the tribe was
poor, and that strangers were expected to make some
offering on coming among them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We were prepared to make presents,&rdquo; said the
Prince good-humouredly, &ldquo;but we object to being
asked for them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The older man&mdash;evidently the Ahithophel of the
tribe&mdash;whispered something, whereupon the chief said
more spiritedly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have been taken prisoners in our forest. You
must ransom yourselves&rdquo;&mdash;Ahithophel whispered
again&mdash;&ldquo;by giving up your arms and your baggage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Those of the Prussians who understood the cacique&rsquo;s
Spanish cocked their pistols.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Patience; we must reason with them,&rdquo; said the
Prince in his own language.</p>
<p>He was trying to think of the most potent argument
to employ, when a sudden outcry arose on all hands,
and more than half the Indians, including the chief
and his evil genius, turned towards the river as though
in haste to meet someone. The canoes which the
travellers had seen from a distance were drawing up to
the wooden landing-stage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s this? What are they all doing?&rdquo; asked
the Prince; as well he might, for his assailants, so
clamorous and threatening only a moment before,
were falling on their knees one after the other, crossing
themselves and shouting jubilantly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The padre! The holy padre!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A pleasant-faced, athletic-looking man, wearing a
large <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">sombrero</i> and a priest&rsquo;s cassock, was standing on
the little quay, holding up his hand to bless the kneeling
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_151' name='page_151'></a>151</span>
crowd, and at the same time throwing a quick
glance of curiosity towards the prisoners.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At least he&rsquo;s a white man,&rdquo; said the Prince, much
relieved, as he signed to Count Oriolla to dismount
and go to speak to the new-comer. In a couple of
minutes he saw both men hurrying towards him. The
priest raised his hat and, in excellent German, introduced
himself as a Scots Jesuit whose duty it was to
make periodical visits to the camps that had no church,
to administer the sacraments to the devout.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must look leniently on them,&rdquo; he said when
the position was explained. &ldquo;They are just grownup
children. I will see that a proper apology is made.
I suspect I can put my hand on the black sheep.&rdquo; He
pointed at Ahithophel, and, speaking in Spanish,
ordered him and the cacique to come forward. Before
he had spoken for a couple of minutes, it was clear
enough to the strangers that the good missionary knew
the class of men with whom he had to deal. Led by
the cacique, the Indians were soon sobbing and groaning
in chorus; and even the grey-headed counsellor
bewailed his indiscretion when, passing from the moral
to the politic side of the question, the Scotsman hinted
at the possibilities of a German invasion to avenge this
insult to royalty; and ended by forbidding anyone in
the village, as a penance, to receive any present whatever
from the travellers.</p>
<p>The power that just one white man of quick brain
and strong will had over all these savages seemed incredible.
The Prussians remained in the village three
days, and during that time the Indians strained every
effort to please and entertain them; not an article of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_152' name='page_152'></a>152</span>
their property was interfered with, and when, on
leaving, the Prince&mdash;forgetting the padre&rsquo;s prohibition&mdash;offered
trifling presents of knives, jewellery, and silk
handkerchiefs, everyone edged away as though these
things were poison.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They have been <em>good</em> children, Father,&rdquo; pleaded
the Prince, and so earnestly that the Jesuit was obliged
to give way; whereupon the Guaranis accepted the
gifts with tears of gratitude, and readily offered a
supply of guides who would ensure the travellers against
molestation by others of their tribe between there and
the Andes.</p>
<p>On the last day of their stay it was reported that a
tapir had been seen in the forest a mile or two back;
and the Scots cleric, himself a keen sportsman, undertook
to show the Prussians a native hunt at its best.
In this, however, he did not quite succeed, for some
of the younger members of the tribe stole a march on
the rest, and the visitors only saw the &ldquo;finish.&rdquo; The
lads had started earlier in the morning, had discovered
the tapir and driven him through the forest towards
the river; and, as the white men reached the most
practicable path, the ungainly beast charged out of it
and made straight towards the water. But the
cacique was too quick for him. Spurring his horse with
the sharp angles of his stirrups, he dashed from the
rear of the Prussians and flung his lasso over the
animal&rsquo;s head.</p>
<p>But this was not all. The tapir cared no more for
this than a whale does for a single harpoon and line,
and rushed straight on for the river, apparently dragging
the hunter with him. All in a moment, however, there
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_153' name='page_153'></a>153</span>
came a clatter of hoofs, a cloud of dead leaves, chips,
and dust, and four of the beaters dashed out from the
forest path with their lassoes poised, and each bawling
like a man possessed. Two lassoes whistled past the
Prince&rsquo;s head and seemed to fall at exactly the same
moment on that of the tapir; these were followed by
a third, which, as the beast had made a half stop, just
missed him; then by a fourth, which fell unerringly.</p>
<p>Even then the power of this strange animal was
amazing, and for a minute it seemed as though he
must draw his captors into the river; but, at a shout
from the cacique, the three hunters followed his
example, swung their horses round, and spurred them so
terrifically that they towed the quarry back, foot by
foot, till he fell over on his side with all the breath
strangled out of him. Then the cacique, as the first
to get his lasso &ldquo;home,&rdquo; handed the thong to another
hunter, dismounted, and gave the tapir his quietus
with his spear.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>
<h3>INDIAN WARFARE IN CALIFORNIA</h3>
</div>
<p>One of America&rsquo;s great naval commanders&mdash;Captain
Henry Augustus Wise&mdash;made use of
the opportunity afforded him by the Mexican
War of 1846-7 to collect material for a very engrossing
account of some Indians concerning whom little was
then known: the coast Comanches of Lower California
and Mexico. The Captain&mdash;a cousin of Governor
Wise of Virginia, and an intimate friend of Rear-Admiral
Wilkes&mdash;was at that time second lieutenant
of the man-of-war <i>Independence</i>, a steamship which
was cruising between San Francisco and the Gulf of
California.</p>
<p>His first acquaintance with the Western redskins
was when he was sent ashore at Monterey, a hundred
and twenty miles south of San Francisco, to reconnoitre
the country and offer protection&mdash;or, if need be,
a means of escape&mdash;to any United States subjects
settled in the district. Let it be remembered that the
California of that day was vastly different even from
the California of two years later. Its hidden gold was
only known to the Comanches and other Shoshonee
tribes, and a few Mexican Spaniards; Monterey was
still the capital, while &ldquo;Frisco&rdquo; was but a little
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_155' name='page_155'></a>155</span>
market-town; above all, the Yankees had as yet
scarce more than a foothold in the state, the greater
part of it being (till the end of that war) under Mexican
sway; and the coast Indians had not yet had their
own virtues knocked out of them and replaced by the
vices of the white diggers of &rsquo;49.</p>
<p>Lieutenant Wise and his boat&rsquo;s crew, on leaving the
town, began to make their way down-country between
the coast and the Buonaventura River, relying for
hospitality mainly on the American settlers, many of
whom did a thriving and regular trade in skins. They
found the district tolerably quiet, though there were
reports of various fierce battles between the Comanches
and their old enemies the Apaches, many of the latter
being, it was said, in the pay of the Mexicans. It was
at a trappers&rsquo; camp that Wise heard this piece of news,
a queer little circle of log-huts erected on a wide clearing
in one of the river forests which they came upon by
accident late one afternoon. The trappers&mdash;all of them
American or American-Irish&mdash;gave a very cordial welcome
to the little party, though they would not at first
admit the necessity for their offer of protection.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See here,&rdquo; said one of them. &ldquo;The Mexicans are
shifting down south right hard, and all you&rsquo;re likely
to see, you&rsquo;ve seen in Monterey. Your ship, or else
some other, has bombarded Santa Barbara already;
and, like as not, is clearing San Diego out by now. As
for the redskins, take an old stager&rsquo;s advice and let
&rsquo;em fight it out theirselves. There&rsquo;s one lot we&rsquo;d like
very well to get hold of, but the rest we don&rsquo;t vally
a cuss.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who are they?&rdquo; asked Wise, sitting down to the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_156' name='page_156'></a>156</span>
meal of grilled deer&rsquo;s meat that was set before
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;More&rsquo;n we can tell ye. Some o&rsquo; that coyotero lot
that have learned to use a rifle; for gun-stealing and
horse and rifle-lifting they&rsquo;ve got no living ekals.
Last week they killed two of our fellows at a camp up
the river; scalped &rsquo;em; broke open the magazine,
and got away with all the powder and lead, as well as
half a dozen spare guns. &rsquo;Twas no good the rest going
to look for &rsquo;em when they came home; p&rsquo;raps they
were half a hundred miles away by then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had orders to seize all firearms found on
Indians,&rdquo; said the lieutenant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And don&rsquo;t forget it,&rdquo; said one of his hosts. &ldquo;Take
my word, them guns, and a good many hundreds beside,
have gone down-country to the Mexicans; and the
Injuns are allowed to keep all the horses and eat all
the mules for their reward.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eat the mules?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What else? What <em>won&rsquo;t</em> Apaches eat, for that
matter? How do you reckon they come to be called
<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">coyoteros</i>? Half of &rsquo;em &rsquo;d live on coyotes&rdquo; (prairie
wolves) &ldquo;and never touch anything more Christian,
if they had their way. Well; I s&rsquo;pose we&rsquo;ll get a visit
from &rsquo;em next; so far we&rsquo;ve lost nothing but horses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are all of you in camp now?&rdquo; asked Wise. At
present he had only seen fourteen men.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; there&rsquo;s six gone across the river to trade for
horses; for, barring what they&rsquo;re riding, we&rsquo;ve only
got one left, and he&rsquo;s sick. If the redskins come ever
so, we can&rsquo;t run after &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can stay till the day after to-morrow, if you
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_157' name='page_157'></a>157</span>
think they&rsquo;re likely to come within that time. I
daren&rsquo;t stay longer, for we&rsquo;re to join the ship at San
Diego on the twenty-sixth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wal; there&rsquo;s eleven of you, and that&rsquo;s a big help;
we shan&rsquo;t say no,&rdquo; said the head trapper. &ldquo;They
might come to-night; might not come for another
six months. You needn&rsquo;t fear for your men&rsquo;s rations;
they won&rsquo;t starve.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When bed-time came, Wise posted five sentries, who
were to be relieved after four hours&rsquo; duty, and went
to the hut set aside for him with his mind at ease.
He was in his first sleep, when he became drowsily
conscious that the report of a rifle was fitting itself
into his dreams. Too tired after his long march to be
much affected by it, he was sleeping peacefully on,
when the familiar, hoarse voice of the boatswain roused
him effectually.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guard, turn out!&mdash;All hands on deck; come on,
there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sailor-like, he was on his feet and into his boots in
a couple of seconds, and was running out, sword in
hand, before the cry could be repeated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hy-yah; hy-yah!&rdquo; someone was shouting; and
the boatswain was answering grimly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; <em>we&rsquo;ll</em> &lsquo;hy-yah&rsquo; ye. Git off&rsquo;n them horses
will ye?&rdquo;</p>
<p>By the firelight Wise could make out three mounted
Indians, a fourth on foot, and, near him, a dead horse
that had, no doubt, fallen before the sentry&rsquo;s rifle.
Around them stood his ten sailors, every man with his
rifle covering one or other of the redskins; while the
trappers, less accustomed to abrupt night-calls, appeared
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_158' name='page_158'></a>158</span>
more slowly, rubbing their eyes and cocking
their guns.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hy-yah! Hy-yah, Mason!&rdquo; Again the high-pitched
nasal voice.</p>
<p>The head trapper, who came stumbling out of his
hut, shouted a few words in the Shoshonee dialect,
and, immediately after:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t fire, there; don&rsquo;t let &rsquo;em fire, Mr. Wise;
they&rsquo;ve copped the wrong men. These are friends;
Comanches,&rdquo; and a great laugh from the trappers
echoed over the camp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I challenged &rsquo;em first,&rdquo; said the sentry who had
fired. &ldquo;How was <em>I</em> to know who they was?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mason, the chief trapper, spoke for a moment or two
with the redskin who had hailed him; then signed to
him and his companions to take their seats by the fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop here, Lootenant, will you? They want to
have a bit of a palaver with us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As they dismounted, Wise could see that the Comanches
were tall, well-made men, very different from
the Creeks and Choctaws of the Atlantic coast. All
had moccasins, and three of them wore sleeveless
jackets of leather; while the fourth was habited in
a magnificent &ldquo;buffalo&rdquo; robe. Each had either the
tail of a polecat or a bunch of leather snippings in
lieu of it, tied to either heel; the front half of their
moccasins was painted blue, the other half red. But
what struck the officer most forcibly was the remarkable
thickness and length of the Indians&rsquo; hair, which
descended almost to their heels. Alas for human
vanity; three parts of those tresses were false; their
own hair and somebody else&rsquo;s, together with a liberal
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_159' name='page_159'></a>159</span>
supply of horses&rsquo; tails, were all matted together with
fat, and secured at the top by their feather head-dresses.</p>
<p>Mason approached the subject in curt, business-like
fashion, rapidly translating to the rest all that the
Indians said, and cutting very short the embroideries,
formalities, and courtesy-titles contained in their address.
It appeared that Comanche scouts had reported
a march of the Apaches towards their own camp; they
were several hundred strong, and were coming across
country from the Rio del Norte direction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Last time we drove them away with great slaughter,&rdquo;
continued the Comanche chief; &ldquo;but they are
more now, and many of them have guns; they are
more confident too, for our scouts learn that they have
inflicted a great defeat on white men.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ask him whereabouts,&rdquo; said Wise hurriedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In Sonora, it is understood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Surely he doesn&rsquo;t expect us to join him?&rdquo; muttered
Wise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; no sich thing. He&rsquo;s only come to say he&rsquo;s
moving his camp from the Buonaventura, so that we
mustn&rsquo;t rely on help from his tribe as heretofore, until
they&rsquo;ve met and whipped the Apaches. His tribe
have always been the best o&rsquo; friends with us. Say, it&rsquo;ll
<em>be</em> a battle; not a make-believe; but bear in mind
what I said; keep out&rsquo;n it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If these Apaches are coming from the del Norte,
they&rsquo;ll probably not be the same as the ones we expect.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never no tellings; they&rsquo;re here to-day, and goodness
knows where to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_160' name='page_160'></a>160</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll stay as long as I said,&rdquo; answered the
lieutenant; and he went back to finish his night&rsquo;s rest.</p>
<p>When he turned out in the morning the Comanches
had long gone and the trappers were discussing plans,
some advocating going about their work as usual,
since the seamen were there to guard the camp; the
rest insisting that both parties ought to lie hidden within
the camp and give it the appearance of being entirely
deserted. As the Apaches, being mounted, would have
such an enormous advantage, whether in the open
field or in eluding pursuit, Wise and Mason decided
upon the latter course, and positions were being
assigned to the men, when, all in a moment, a dozen
rifles blazed out from beyond the edge of the clearing;
bullets rattled against the huts, and two of the trappers
fell back wounded.</p>
<p>A roar of vengeance rose from all except the sailors,
who, catching their officer&rsquo;s eye, at once sent an
answering volley among the trees.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re on foot,&rdquo; screamed one trapper as he
snatched up his gun and ran like a madman across the
clearing. &ldquo;Come on, boys; there they go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fall in,&rdquo; said Wise shortly; then turned to Mason.
&ldquo;This is a bad business for you chaps&mdash;but we must go
to work in a proper fashion. You can spot their trail
better than we; go on, we&rsquo;ll follow you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With the exception of the delirious person who had
already gone in pursuit, the trappers collected in an
orderly manner, each man swiftly examining his
stock of ammunition and snatching up whatever food
lay to hand; and all were ready to start at a sign from
Mason.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_161' name='page_161'></a>161</span></div>
<p>The noisy man was soon caught up with, bidden to
hold his tongue and go back to attend to his two
wounded comrades, and the chase began in good earnest.
Every trapper had his special business to attend to, for
the trail of each Indian had to be discovered, and, from
the fact that all the twelve men were soon following a
separate course, Wise gathered that the redskins had
more or less dispersed in their flight. He merely
occupied himself with keeping his men together, and
as nearly as possible in touch with all of the trappers.
For half an hour they proceeded at an easy trot, and
so came to a long, narrow pool. Mason gave a single
whistle and stopped, and everyone closed in on him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Strangers,&rdquo; he murmured. His mates knew what
he meant. The redskins had halted here in doubt
about the depth; the stillness of the water showed
that it had not been disturbed recently, and the trail
proved that they had turned both left and right.
&ldquo;Three of you cross; if you don&rsquo;t signal in two
minutes we shall divide and follow both trails.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The men knew well enough that just here the pool
was but five feet deep at the very most, and three of
them ran through it. Mason took out his watch, and,
just after the final second had expired, a whistle was
heard ahead. The main trail had been found. With
their guns held high above their heads, the Yankees
slid down the bank and crossed the water, and the
double began again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Without they&rsquo;ve got horses waiting for &rsquo;em, this
looks like a &lsquo;find,&rsquo;&rdquo; said Mason over his shoulder.
&ldquo;We shall come slap on to the prairie this way; and
that&rsquo;s as level as a billiard-table for nigh on ten miles;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_162' name='page_162'></a>162</span>
and we&rsquo;ve gained a rare big pull in crossing the
pond.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was as he had said; in about another half-hour
the forest came to an abrupt end.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There they go,&rdquo; shouted one excitable man; and
this time a cheer rose from the sailors. The Indians,
twelve of them, were scarcely a mile away, walking
and running by turns, and to all appearances beginning
to knock up, though they made a fresh spurt
at sight of their pursuers.</p>
<p>The lieutenant now felt himself in a difficult position.
These trappers had seen two of their friends shot
down&mdash;perhaps killed&mdash;only an hour or so ago; and,
though the average man of Anglo-Saxon blood (save
him of cheap and nasty melodrama) is far too manly
a fellow to be able to nourish revenge for an indefinite
period, he may be a dangerous customer while the
memory of a grievance is still fresh. Wise badly wanted
the fugitives&rsquo; muskets; he wanted to arrest the owners
of them; if need were, to hang them, in requital of
their murderous attack; but he did not want to see
them riddled with bullets and hacked with bowie-knives
by men wild with passion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think you&rsquo;d better leave this to us now,&rdquo; he
whispered to Mason, who was a man open to reason.
The old trapper shook his head, however.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish I could,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but it&rsquo;s no use trying.
They&rsquo;ve got a good many old scores against the
varmints, and this one coming atop&mdash;Wal!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then it&rsquo;s going to be a race,&rdquo; said the lieutenant,
with decision; and he bade his men quicken their
double, in the faint hope of their being able to outrun
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_163' name='page_163'></a>163</span>
the trappers. But, as things turned out, the
difficulty was removed from his hands. For some few
minutes he had noticed a thick mass of moving figures
across the plain some distance farther to the left than
the point for which the Indians were making. At
first he had taken them for cattle; but, on closer
inspection, he saw that they were mounted men. He
pointed them out to Mason, who was now twenty yards
behind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; I see &rsquo;em,&rdquo; he shouted. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a battle;
Comanches and Apaches, I count.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the sailors&rsquo; excitement they almost forgot the
objects of their pursuit, though these were again
showing unmistakable signs of breaking down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, lads; one good spurt and we&rsquo;ll be within
range,&rdquo; said Wise. &ldquo;Never mind about what&rsquo;s going
on over there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But it was not in human nature not to watch what
could be seen of the combat; Wise himself could not
resist the temptation; one side was already taking
flight, shooting at their pursuers as they went; and
the two forces formed, with Wise&rsquo;s men, two converging
lines which would very soon meet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Apaches have had enough; they&rsquo;re making
for the mountains, and this here other lot of reptiles&rsquo;ll
get away on the first horses they can come near,&rdquo;
shouted Mason from behind.</p>
<p>In a few minutes the first of the Indian forces was
only half a mile away from the sailors&rsquo; line of march.
No doubt they had come to the hopeless stage in
Indian warfare; the stage at which all arrows or
bullets have been shot away and it is a question either
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_164' name='page_164'></a>164</span>
of close fighting&mdash;for which they have neither strength
nor stomach&mdash;or of flight. But, strangely enough,
the Indians on foot made no attempt to join their
brethren; instead, they wheeled more than ever to
the right.</p>
<p>For the next few minutes, things were little more
than a confused blur to Wise; the dust was flying; he
scarcely knew one party from the other; he was bewildered
by the yelling of both, and by the lightning
speed at which pursued and pursuers moved; in fact,
he knew nothing definitely till a shout of triumph
arose from the trappers behind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>Got &rsquo;em!</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Comanches, abandoning the hope of overtaking
their enemy, had wheeled suddenly, and closed round
the twelve scattering Apaches who were on foot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guess it&rsquo;s out of our hands now, anyway,&rdquo; said
Wise to the boatswain. Just then two of the Comanches
turned their horses and cantered up to the
sailors; at the same time the trappers joined them
from behind, impelled by curiosity; and Wise heard
old Mason talking with one of the men who had entered
the camp the night before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He says, does the young white chief&mdash;that&rsquo;s <em>you</em>,
gov&rsquo;nor&mdash;want them Mexicans? If not, they calculate
<em>they</em> can find a use for &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>Mexicans?</em>&rdquo; said Wise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay; what do ye think of &rsquo;em? Mexican spies and
gun-runners, dressed and painted up as Apaches, as
I&rsquo;m a sinner. If we&rsquo;d had a redskin with us he&rsquo;d ha&rsquo;
seen through &rsquo;em in a jiff.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The pseudo-Apaches were soon bound and, despite
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_165' name='page_165'></a>165</span>
the protest of the trappers, taken in charge by Wise,
who handed them over to the first military picket he
met. They were one of the many parties sent out by
the Mexicans to steal guns, ammunition, horses, and
information, and had visited the trappers&rsquo; camp that
morning in the hope of making a haul of weapons.
Finding it garrisoned they had run away again,
venting their disappointment in a hasty volley at the
men who wore the Government uniform, secure, as they
flattered themselves, from pursuit through the trappers&rsquo;
having no horses. Lieutenant Wise had many
more exciting adventures before that war was ended,
but these did not again bring him in touch with the
warfare of redskins, whether genuine or sham.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>
<h3>WITH THE AYMARAS AND MOXOS</h3>
</div>
<p>There is no part of the American continent,
save perhaps Guatemala (and, of course, the
Arctic Regions), where the Indian race has survived
in such power and&mdash;relatively&mdash;such numbers
as in Bolivia. At the last census, the entire population
of the republic was two millions, and of that number
the whites, blacks, and half-bloods together amounted
to less than three hundred thousand. The coast Indians
belong mainly to the Colla (more commonly called
Aymara) tribe of the Quechuan family, and, unlike
the average redskin, are square and squat in build;
long in the arms and body and short in the legs; many
of them have passed their lives entirely on the mountains
and have never seen a lowland river or town.</p>
<p>In Bolivia there is no British Consulate, for Britishers
there are almost as rare as Samoyeds; but as a rule
there is some semi-official chargé d&rsquo;affaires in residence.
From 1848 to 1855 this office was filled by a young
Englishman of Italian extraction&mdash;Hugh de Bonelli;
and much of that time he passed exclusively among
Indians; hunting, sight-seeing, mountaineering, and
collecting natural history specimens.</p>
<p>In mixing among the Aymaras, one of the first
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_167' name='page_167'></a>167</span>
things he discovered was that, though himself an
exceptionally good walker, he was a baby at such
exercise when pitted against them. While staying at a
native village on Lake Titicaca, he expressed a wish
to visit a spot rather less attractive than the Sahara&mdash;the
Atacama Desert, to wit, which lies between the
coast and the Andes. Plenty of men were willing to
guide him, though they cautioned him that they could
not be spared for more than a day or two, because a
general meeting of the tribe was about to take place.
Now as the lake lies more than twelve thousand feet
above the sea-level, and when this prodigious descent
had been made, there would be several miles to traverse
on foot, he wisely abandoned the project. Nevertheless,
being curious to test the truth of the reports he
had heard as to their long walks, he accompanied a
party of Aymaras who were bound for the far end of
the lake with loads of silver.</p>
<p>They started at sunrise, and the mountain air being
deliciously cool, he was not at first incommoded by the
pace at which they went. But that pace was five miles
an hour!</p>
<p>He kept up easily the first two hours, and, with
considerably more difficulty, the second two; five
miles in one hour, and twenty in four hours, are
however, not quite the same thing; and when he had
walked the twenty-second mile, he was ready to drop
from fatigue and hunger. Yet they showed no signs
of being about to stop; and conversation was not
easy, for only one of the number understood Spanish,
and that very scantily; the language of the Aymaras
being almost pure Quechuan, i.e. the tongue of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_168' name='page_168'></a>168</span>
ancient Incas, who founded their wonderful empire
when we English were vainly endeavouring to ward
off invasion by the Normans. He explained that he
was both tired and hungry, and, at last growing
desperate, inquired where he could get a mule. Happily
that article was obtainable at a village which they were
now approaching, and, his curiosity thoroughly aroused
as to how far they intended going, he ambled on after
them (for they had not deigned to stop while he concluded
his bargain), caught them, and kept up with
them, though he was now almost too stiff to sit his
mule and too tired to enjoy the food which he had
brought with him.</p>
<p>The thirty-fifth mile was reached before those
energetic Indians stopped, and de Bonelli wished he
had with him some of the people who make the sweeping
statement that &ldquo;all Indians are lazy.&rdquo; He expected
to see them bivouac for at least a couple of
hours; instead of this, not one man sat down; all
stood or lounged, as though they knew by instinct
that the walker who allows his muscles to relax completely
is doubling the strain of the after walk; and
the standing only lasted long enough to enable them
to eat their meal&mdash;twenty minutes at the outside.
Then on again. <em>Seventy miles</em> did these indolent
wretches walk between sunrise and sunset, only
stopping for that one brief meal. It sounds incredible,
but even greater distances are stated, on the best
authority, to have been covered by members of this
wonderful tribe.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>De Bonelli found a contrast when, after some weeks&rsquo;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_169' name='page_169'></a>169</span>
condor and wild-cat shooting in the mountains, he
descended to the lowlands and moved for a while
among the Moxos of the Beni River. A member of
this tribe had come up to Titicaca, as ambassador from
his cacique, to treat for the barter of copper and turtle-oil
for mountain silver; and the inquiring traveller
was glad to engage him as a guide to the Lower Beni,
which he was anxious to trace as far as its junction
with the Mamore, the chief feeder of the Madeira
River.</p>
<p>De Bonelli was bound to admit that the Moxo was
to be preferred as a companion; he was chatty, light-hearted,
and witty, whereas the Aymaras had a sort
of Puritan austerity and were devoid of sense of
humour; he spoke Spanish and they did not; and
further, he considered twenty miles&mdash;with a four
hours&rsquo; siesta between the two tens&mdash;an ample day&rsquo;s
walk. Better still, on the fourth day he produced a
canoe from a cunning hiding-place among the undergrowth
by the river, and thenceforward the journey
became a luxurious holiday; for the woods on either
bank were, to all intents and purposes, orchards, the
fish was delicious and easily caught, and the Moxo
guide kept the boat well supplied with venison and
peccary-pork.</p>
<p>The Indian&rsquo;s destination was a large village about
fifty miles from the Brazilian frontier, and, as the
canoe drew near to it, de Bonelli observed that they
were continually overtaking or being overtaken by
other canoes; not tiny boats, manned singly or by
twos, such as he had seen higher up the river, but
large family concerns; houseboats, literally; for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_170' name='page_170'></a>170</span>
everyone carried a family and all the cooking utensils,
tools, weapons, toys, etc., that it might require.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is the great egg-gathering,&rdquo; said the Moxo enthusiastically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean that the whole tribe is turning out to
go bird&rsquo;s-nesting?&rdquo; asked the white man with good-humoured
contempt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our birds are water-birds, with houses on their
backs,&rdquo; laughed the Indian. &ldquo;Turtles!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Even then I shouldn&rsquo;t have thought several hundred
people were required to take the eggs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You shall judge presently, Señor. The cacique was
sending out the order for the people to collect when I
left. No one may touch the eggs till he grants permission.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They found the Indian village overflowing with
detachments of new arrivals. De Bonelli was introduced
to the cacique, who was so overjoyed by the
present of a silver-mounted pistol that he was ready to
place the whole town and its resources at his visitor&rsquo;s
feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pray stay among us as long as you will,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;Our egg-taking begins to-morrow and will last for
about a week; but, after that, I and my tribe will be
at your service, and I can promise you better hunting
than you have seen with the gloomy Aymaras.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The noise in and around the village aroused the
traveller at an early hour in the morning, and he
strolled out from his tent to survey the neighbourhood.
Since the previous night the village had swelled to
four times its size; for on every side pyramidal tents
had been erected by the simple process of sticking
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_171' name='page_171'></a>171</span>
three poles in the ground, sloping so that the tops met,
and covering the spaces between the poles with mats
made of grass or palm-leaves. The cacique was already
at breakfast, which he begged his guest to share; and,
when it was finished, he said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will do me the favour to ride in my canoe.
Then you will be able to see all my people at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They proceeded to the water-edge and found all the
tribe&mdash;nearly two hundred men with their wives and
children&mdash;seated in canoes and impatiently awaiting
their chief&rsquo;s arrival as the signal to start. The moment
he and his guest were embarked, a great shout went up
and paddling began with a will, the canoes moving at
such a rate that the journey to the &ldquo;turtle-ground,&rdquo;
five miles away, seemed to occupy no time. Arrived
here the chief&rsquo;s paddlers drew in and he and de Bonelli
landed, the tribe following in due order of importance.</p>
<p>As an amateur naturalist the chargé d&rsquo;affaires knew
something of the habits of the turtle, but he was not
prepared for many things which he saw that day.
Turtles seldom lay their eggs immediately by the
water; as often as not they choose a place half a mile
or more away from it. In this case the row of
&ldquo;nests&rdquo; took the form of a long sand-bank which lay
between two fringes of trees, and this, the traveller
learned, had been stealthily and jealously watched by
spies from the village for some weeks past, so that there
could be no mistaking the spot. Behind the cacique
walked a man with a drum, and, as soon as the bank
was reached, a short &ldquo;call&rdquo; was beaten and all the
men, every one carrying a paddle, collected round him.
The chief made a short speech, enjoining patience,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_172' name='page_172'></a>172</span>
industry, and good temper, and then began to portion
off the bank among the men, each family thus being
entitled to whatever they might find in their patch.</p>
<p>The reader is probably aware that the turtle, like
many other reptiles, deposits her eggs in the ground,
and carefully covers them with sand or soft earth.
Through this covering the fierce sun of the tropics can
easily penetrate, and in a short time&mdash;if left alone&mdash;the
young are hatched. And what a family! One to two
hundred eggs, and sometimes more, are laid by this
prolific creature.<a name='FNanchor_n0002' id='FNanchor_n0002'></a><a href='#Footnote_n0002' class='fnanchor'>[2]</a> When every man had taken up his
station at his &ldquo;claim,&rdquo; his wife and children went and
stood at the other side of the bank opposite him, and
everyone waited breathlessly for the signal to begin;
for etiquette forbade the stirring of a single egg till
the cacique had formally opened the patch which
belonged to him. He made a sign to the drummer,
who handed him a paddle, with which he turned over
a spadeful of earth. Immediately there followed a
long roll of the drum, and every man struck his paddle
into the ground and began to dig.</p>
<p>De Bonelli could scarcely believe his eyes; the
place seemed alive with turtle-eggs; yellowish, globular
objects considerably larger than a golf-ball, with
a soft but very tough shell. As fast as a &ldquo;nest&rdquo; was
turned out by the digger, his wife and children collected
the eggs, throwing them into bags, baskets, or
copper pots; and, by evening, the canoes were so full
that it was a wonder how the families stowed themselves
away.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_173' name='page_173'></a>173</span></div>
<p>The return journey was like the home-coming of a
party of hop-pickers, for jubilation and noise, the only
difference being that these benighted Moxos were perfectly
sober, and that their singing consisted mainly of
hymns in a mixture of Spanish, native dialect, and
truly barbarous Latin, instead of music-hall songs. On
reaching the village each family carried its share of
eggs to its tent and piled them up outside, and a feast
of some of these delicacies followed, recalling the
&ldquo;herring-breakfasts&rdquo; in which the more old-fashioned
of our fishermen indulge at the opening of the season.</p>
<p>The next day the digging was continued, though no
opening ceremony was observed, each man beginning
when he thought fit; and this went on for five days,
most of which time de Bonelli spent in teaching the
cacique the use of firearms&mdash;a task which he would
probably better have left undone&mdash;and in shooting
jaguars and alligators. The sixth day was passed in
the village, for the eggs were now all gathered and all
the tribe were busy converting their eggs into oil.</p>
<p>Large copper tanks were filled with the eggs; those
Indians who had come from a distance and could not
borrow tanks, borrowed small canoes for the purpose,
which seemed to do equally well; and the owners set
to work to break the eggs, which they did by beating
them with sticks, stones, paddles, or anything that
came handy. In some cases the younger men and
boys jumped into the tank and danced on them, as
though they were treading a wine-press; and by and
by the various receptacles were half full of a dirty
yellow mash. The women now came toiling up from
the river-bank with pots of water, which they poured
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_174' name='page_174'></a>174</span>
into the tanks till the mixture rose nearly to the
top.</p>
<p>By this time the dinner and siesta-hour had come
round, and the tanks were left to take care of themselves;
good care, too, thought de Bonelli, as he walked
round, an hour or two later, with the chief. While the
workers slept, the sun had done their work for them;
had warmed the tanks, freed the oleaginous particles
contained in the eggs, and now the top of every tank
was several inches deep in oil, which the Indians were
preparing to skim off and bale into their cooking-pots;
the skimming being done by means of large shells. By
evening the whole village was dotted with small fires
over which hung pots of oil; and the oil, thus clarified,
was ultimately poured into earthenware pots, corked
up, and ready to be exported to the towns for use in
lamps, or carried up the river and across country to the
hills, where the Aymaras were willing to pay high
prices in silver for a product which could be used for
fuel, light, or even food.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>
<h3>A SPORTING TRIP ACROSS THE PRAIRIES</h3>
</div>
<p>There is nothing extraordinary to the English
reader in a man&rsquo;s making a sixteen-hundred-mile
journey across lonesome prairies and
mountain-ranges, where railways are almost unknown
and fierce tribes of savages abound, merely for the sake
of shooting big game; for if we do not take our
pleasures sadly, we at least are proud to devote to our
sports as much energy and self-discipline as another
nation would bestow on its politics or monetary interests.</p>
<p>After a good deal of rambling through the eastern
States, Mr. Henry Coke, brother of the second Earl
of Leicester, found himself wandering one morning, in
the year 1850, about the streets of St. Louis, already
sickened of town life and eager for something more
wholesome and natural. Generally it is only in story-books
that a happy coincidence suddenly arises to help
a man out of a difficulty; but real life also has its
chance meetings and its odd bits of luck, and so Mr.
Coke thought when, on turning a corner, he found his
arm seized by an old Cambridge chum of whom he had
heard nothing for three years.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_176' name='page_176'></a>176</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Why, man, what are you doing here?&rdquo; he demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Packing up. I&rsquo;m off for the Columbia River to-morrow,
salmon-fishing. You&rsquo;d better come and make
a sixth; I&rsquo;m travelling with four Canadian chaps;
everything&rsquo;s arranged: horses, waggons, mules, stores,
and even a redskin guide.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was no resisting such a temptation, especially
as Coke had never been farther west than Kansas City,
had only caught salmon in Norway and Scotland, had
never seen a bison or a grisly except in a show, and had
never met with any Indians who were not perfectly
respectable and law-abiding. Therefore he never
dreamt of hesitating, but hastened away to make a
few necessary purchases, and, the next morning, presented
himself at his friends&rsquo; inn, where he found nine
mules, eight riding-horses, and two waggons drawn up,
and his friend&rsquo;s valet vainly endeavouring to get into
conversation with a particularly morose-looking Indian
who sat on the front-board of one of the waggons.</p>
<p>The early days of the journey were occupied by the
sportsmen, as such days generally are, in getting to
know one another and in settling down to a novel
mode of life. The young Canadians were the sons of
a wealthy stock-breeder and were taking a year&rsquo;s
furlough in order to see the States; and no more
valuable companions could have been found; for, if
they were ignorant of the route, there was not much
left for them to learn where prairie and forest life and
the ways of Indians and wild beasts were concerned.
For the first week or so the party managed each night
to put up at some wayside inn or farm; but they no
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_177' name='page_177'></a>177</span>
sooner came on to the wilds of Kansas than the mere
aspect of the country was sufficient to tell them that
they had probably bidden good-bye to eastern civilisation.
The way that now lay before them, if seen from
a balloon, would have looked like a gigantic staircase
whose treads sloped slightly upwards and whose uprights
were low, ragged-faced bluffs that seemed to
hint at the advisability of abandoning the waggons as
henceforth useless, and teaching the horses and mules
to take flying ten-foot jumps. The guide, however,
seemed fairly confident in his ability to find suitable
inclines, and at least for some fifty miles they were able
to follow a very rough track that was a guide in itself.</p>
<p>But the Indian&mdash;one of the Crow tribe&mdash;grew more
sullen and silent and discontented as each new platform
of ground was reached; so much so, that George
Dumont, the eldest of the Canadians, who was perfectly
familiar with the Siouan tongue, began to
question him closely as to the cause of his grumbling
demeanour.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is no use trying to go any farther,&rdquo; said the
Crow moodily. &ldquo;The next bluff is quite impassable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then why didn&rsquo;t you say so before we left
St. Louis?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Indian shelved the question. &ldquo;And even if it
were not, the country here is full of Comanches and
Pawnees and Shoshonees. Did I not warn you of
<em>that</em>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, if that&rsquo;s all,&rdquo; said the Canadian, laughing,
&ldquo;don&rsquo;t frighten yourself. They won&rsquo;t hurt us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Indian shrugged his shoulders and said no more;
but presently he stood up on the footboard and, attracting
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_178' name='page_178'></a>178</span>
Dumont&rsquo;s attention, pointed triumphantly to
a bluff about a furlong ahead, which had been hitherto
concealed by a ridge of rising ground dotted with pine-trees.
Coke, who had been riding some way in advance
with his friend, now hurried back to Dumont&rsquo;s side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you make of this?&rdquo; he said, pointing to
the bluff. &ldquo;Fred&rsquo;s ridden off to the right to try and
find a slope, and I&rsquo;m just off the opposite way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dumont rode with him as far as the obstruction and
examined it more carefully; it was a sheer precipice,
twelve feet high.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right you are,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Try and find a slope,
and I&rsquo;ll wait here for the other fellows.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Two hours later the men met again; the two scouts
had ridden ten miles along the cliff-foot either way,
only to find that there was no spot where the waggons
could possibly be raised. Meanwhile, two of the
Dumonts had scooped footholds for themselves and
climbed to the higher level, which they pronounced to
be a beautiful grass plain, studded with little conical
hills; and by the aid of a telescope they had seen
large herds of bison going on ahead towards the Platte
River.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then we must go on,&rdquo; said Coke, &ldquo;even if we
have to haul the waggons after us, or cut a roadway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The others were of the same mind, but the sun had
just set, and whatever their plans might be, they would
have to stand over till to-morrow. The fire was lit and
all were sitting down to supper when someone asked:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s the redskin?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The redskin had gone, bag and baggage (someone
else&rsquo;s baggage).</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_179' name='page_179'></a>179</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Why, he&rsquo;s collared your new gun, Coke,&rdquo; shouted
Fred, who had jumped up into the waggon in which the
Indian had ridden and was making a hurried search,
&ldquo;And&mdash;whew! my little valise as well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The gun was a large-bore rifle of a new pattern,
which Coke had only obtained with difficulty at the
last moment; but even this theft, annoying as it was,
was of minor importance compared with the disappearance
of the valise, which contained all such
maps and charts as its owner had been able to procure,
some money, and his letters of introduction to people
in Washington and across the boundary.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mounted or on foot?&rdquo; asked Paul Dumont, the
youngest of the brothers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Horses and mules all here, sir,&rdquo; reported the manservant
after a brisk look round.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then come on, Coke; up with you,&rdquo; said young
Paul. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have him,&rdquo; and taking the two best of
the horses, they were soon galloping along the path by
which they had come. In a few minutes they were past
the ridge with its little belt of trees, beyond which all
was plain sailing&mdash;or would have been if only the light
could have lasted a little longer; for here was only a
treeless, imperceptibly sloping plain where even an
Indian could scarcely hope to conceal himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fellow must be a perfect ass to think he could
get away from us here,&rdquo; said Coke. &ldquo;There you are;
there goes the gentleman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A couple of miles ahead was a dark, moving dot,
evidently the Indian trotting along at a good round
pace.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ass enough to know that there&rsquo;s precious little
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_180' name='page_180'></a>180</span>
twilight now, at any rate,&rdquo; said Paul ruefully, as he
urged on his horse. &ldquo;And there&rsquo;s no moon till after
midnight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They rode the next mile in silence, and, at the end of
it, were no longer able to distinguish the fleeing figure
with any degree of certainty. In another few minutes
they were at the spot where they had first seen the
Indian, but there was hardly enough light for even the
keen-sighted Canadian to detect any trail.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no use thinking of giving up,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We
must have the bag if we ride all night for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again they spurred the horses to a gallop, peering
all the while on either side of them; and in this
manner they covered another few miles. Farther than
this the Indian could not possibly have gone in the
time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better divide, and prowl round,&rdquo; said Coke.
&ldquo;Fire a pistol if you see anything, and I&rsquo;ll do the
same.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He rode away at a gentle trot, pausing now and then
to listen. After half an hour of this he heard the pop
of a pistol a good way behind him, yet distinct enough
in the silent night air. Wheeling round, he looked
steadily before him in the hope of seeing the flash of
a second report. This came after a few seconds, and he
at once responded to it.</p>
<p>But even before he saw the flash he had noticed
something else of far more importance: a little glow
of flame on the ground a few miles away, somewhere
about in the direction which Dumont had started to
follow. And now, coming towards him, was the steady
thud of a horse&rsquo;s hoofs.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_181' name='page_181'></a>181</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;That you, Paul?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay; come on,&rdquo; sounded from a mounted figure
that was beginning to stand out indistinctly against
the blue-black of the sky. The two young men were
soon together again, and Dumont pointed towards the
flame.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Redskins. Thought I&rsquo;d better come back and meet
you first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How many?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I could make out three. They couldn&rsquo;t hear my
shots with the wind this way; I didn&rsquo;t hear yours;
only saw the flash. Now for a little bit of spying. Are
you well loaded up?&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were soon within a pistol-shot of the fire, in the
light of which shone the bodies of three Indians, naked
as far as the waist. The Englishman&rsquo;s heart beat with
excitement, for as yet he had never been so close to
Indians who were real savages. A few more steps and
then the Indians, not to be taken altogether by surprise,
sprang erect and stood with bowstrings stretched.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pawnees, I think,&rdquo; said Dumont, reining up. He
shouted some words in the Siouan dialect, and was
answered by what seemed to Coke merely a series of
grunts.</p>
<p>Again the Canadian spoke, and on receiving a brief
reply moved on again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on,&rdquo; he said triumphantly. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ve got
him; they&rsquo;ve got our man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the two white men, stiff and hungry, got down
from their saddles, the Pawnees advanced cautiously
to meet them, their bows still bent. Paul, however,
made some masonic motions with his hands which were
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_182' name='page_182'></a>182</span>
understood as meaning peace, and each returned his
arrow to his quiver.</p>
<p>A conversation began which, to the Englishman,
was very much worse than any Greek, and so gave
him leisure to look about him. Now that his eyes had
become accustomed to the glare of the fire, the first
thing he saw clearly was the runaway guide, bound so
tightly with thongs that the poor creature could not
move an inch. Near him lay the stolen rifle and his
friend&rsquo;s valise, the latter disgorging papers through an
opening which had been slashed along one side of it.</p>
<p>Regardless of a murmur of protest from the savages,
young Dumont picked up the gun and handed it to its
owner, and having satisfied himself that none of the
papers were missing, strapped the bag across his own
shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must pay us for them,&rdquo; said the Pawnees
discontentedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes; all right. Come to our camp in the
morning, and we&rsquo;ll give you what is reasonable. What
do you propose doing with this man?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We shall take him to our camp.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll swear you shan&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Dumont in English;
for he knew what sort of mercy a trespassing Crow
might expect from the Pawnees.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell them we&rsquo;ll fight them or we&rsquo;ll buy the chap of
them, which they like,&rdquo; said Coke, when the position
was explained to him.</p>
<p>A debate followed in which Paul showed himself a
shrewd bargainer. He and Coke totted up their
available assets, and eventually about a quarter of a
pint of whisky, a penknife, a steel watch-chain, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_183' name='page_183'></a>183</span>
four or five shillings&rsquo; worth of small silver were offered
as the Crow&rsquo;s ransom, and accepted, much to the
astonishment of Coke, who, in his innocence, had been
about to add a valuable ring and a pair of pocket-pistols
to the purchase-money. He stooped and cut
the prisoner&rsquo;s bonds, and that worthy, in obedience to a
threatening hint from Dumont, fled into the darkness.</p>
<p>The Indians were amicably inclined, and not only
shared their supper of broiled deer&rsquo;s meat with the
travellers, but agreed to call for them at the camp in
the morning and lead them to a point where the
waggons could easily be drawn up to the higher platform;
and on this good understanding the young men
rode away. The new guides were as good as their word,
and appeared on their little mustangs before Coke&rsquo;s
party had finished breakfast. They appeared to be one
of several small scouting parties sent out from a main
camp farther on to gather intelligence as to a reported
advance of the Crow Indians against them; and were
now returning to their head-quarters beyond the Platte
River. Instructed by them, the sportsmen moved
along the bluff to a place about three miles farther
than Coke had ridden on the previous afternoon; and
there found a tolerably easy incline, up which the
waggons were soon dragged.</p>
<p>By the side of the first of the hills seen the day before,
the noonday halt was made. The Pawnees still continued
very friendly, the more so on discovering that
nothing but the desire to do battle with bisons and
grisly bears had brought the pale-faces so far.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To-morrow we will show you many bisons,&rdquo; they
said; and they certainly kept their promise.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_184' name='page_184'></a>184</span></div>
<p>All that afternoon the sportsmen could trace the
steady passage north-westwards of herd after herd of
the animals; at that distance merely a brown, moving
blur; and Coke wondered how the Indians ever proposed
to come up with them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They will go no farther than the river,&rdquo; said the
Pawnees, when questioned.</p>
<p>On the afternoon of the next day, as the little
procession came near to another of the mound-like
hills, the guides called a halt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are too few to attack a herd,&rdquo; they said. &ldquo;We
must watch for the stragglers which may be grazing
on the slopes. Go very quietly and do not raise your
voices. Follow us and leave the waggons here.&rdquo; They
moved on their horses again at a quick walk, and the
white men did the same, till they had gone nearly half
round the base of the hill, when the Pawnees pulled up
with a jerk, and one of them spoke hurriedly to George
Dumont, who rode immediately behind the guides.</p>
<p>On the hillside about twenty bisons were grazing;
and it seemed the easiest thing in the world to cut them
off from the rest of the herd, which, to the number of
three or four hundred, were moving slowly towards
the river, now plainly to be seen flashing in the far
distance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; said George, turning to the Englishmen,
and speaking with evident embarrassment.
&ldquo;They mean to make us prove our pretensions to
being mighty hunters. Two of them are going round
the farther side to keep the bulls from wandering,
and this chap is going to captain us. We&rsquo;ve got
to guard the valley and this side of the hill; but
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_185' name='page_185'></a>185</span>
as you fellows are new to it&mdash;if you&rsquo;d rather not be in
it&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, bosh!&rdquo; said Coke; &ldquo;we&rsquo;re going to stand
by you and get our share of the fun.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh&mdash;of course; if you feel sure of yourselves.
Well; keep an eye open for the game beyond. They
have a nasty trick of coming to each other&rsquo;s
assistance.&rdquo; He made a sign to the two foremost
Indians, who galloped away without a word, and were
soon invisible behind the loitering bisons. Then the
Englishmen saw what sort of sport they were letting
themselves in for. They were to stop the probable
downward and sideward rush of twenty bulls, killing
as many of them as they could, and be prepared at the
same time for an attack by the remaining hundreds
that, at the first gunshot, might turn on them in a body.
Daily, for the past fortnight, both of them had zealously
practised shooting with a rifle while at the gallop; but
what sort of experience was that to bring to a task
which the Canadians, used from boyhood to bison-hunting,
admitted was a dangerous one?</p>
<p>Low as the voices had been, the stragglers had heard
them and were beginning to look nervously from side
to side. Suddenly a white streak darted through the
air, and with an awful bellow one of the bisons fell,
pierced through the eye by an arrow, and began to roll
helplessly down the grassy slope. The remaining
Pawnee had drawn first blood. But a second after, the
four Canadians brought their guns to the shoulder and
fired one after the other; two beasts fell dead and two
more showed by their groaning that they were badly
wounded.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_186' name='page_186'></a>186</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Here goes,&rdquo; said Fred; and in another moment
he had shot his first bison.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get more to your left, or they&rsquo;ll bolt yet,&rdquo; shouted
Dominique Dumont; and Coke, with an uncomfortable
impression that the whole herd was charging upon
him from the rear, nevertheless spurred his horse sidewards
for several yards; then fired at a bull which was
endeavouring to flee down the near side of the hill;
and with a thrill of pride saw him fall on his knees
and then roll over.</p>
<p>The excitement of the hunt was on him now and he
thought no more of the herd behind him. Had he
looked back he might have seen that alarms on that
score were groundless; for, contrary to their usual
custom, at the first shot they had fled in a body. But
it was their desertion that made the loiterers so determined
to escape and rejoin them. Three more of their
number had fallen dead or disabled before the arrows
of the Pawnees on the farther side, who could now
be seen pressing the game more closely; and, at a sign
from the other Indian, the party in the valley now
spurred up the hill, the six guns all crashing out together.</p>
<p>In despair the remaining bulls sought the only sure
escape open to them, and charged up the hill. Fred,
the best mounted of the white men, was soon ahead of
the rest, and, deaf to a laughing shout of &ldquo;Whoa!
Don&rsquo;t be in a hurry,&rdquo; from Paul Dumont, was soon
on the heels of the biggest of the bisons. He had
but one barrel loaded; the bullet took the animal in
the hindquarters, making him stop and turn. The
next thing Fred knew was that he was lying bruised
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_187' name='page_187'></a>187</span>
and giddy, on his back, within a very few yards of the
maddened brute; for his horse, young and easily confused,
had suddenly reared at sight of the monster&rsquo;s
motion towards him and had thrown his rider.</p>
<div class='figcenter'>
<div class='figtag'>
<a name='linki_11' id='linki_11'></a>

<img src='images/i199.jpg' alt='' title='' width='500' height='299' /><br />
<p class='caption'>
<span class='smcap'>Almost a Tragedy</span><br />
<br />
Fred had fired at the bison, but only hit it in the hind-quarters. It stopped and turned, frightening the horse, which threw its rider within a few yards of the maddened brute. His friends were powerless to help him, but a Pawnee on his wiry little mustang galloped up between them and with a couple of arrows brought the monster down.<br />
</p>
</div>
<p>Coke had reloaded by this time, but at first his aim
was baulked by the prancing horse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shoot the confounded horse; he&rsquo;ll kick him to
death,&rdquo; yelled George Dumont in his ear, at the same
time frantically pushing a cartridge into the empty
breech of his own gun; but just then the horse swerved
and fled down the hill towards the waggons. The bull,
meanwhile, seeing his enemy at his mercy, had paused
just for a moment as though to take breath; and now,
with his nose to the ground, was making a wild dash
towards him.</p>
<p>Coke pulled up, took good aim, and fired; but unluckily,
the bullet which was meant for the bison&rsquo;s
shoulder caught him on the frontlet, his most hopelessly
invulnerable part. The three younger Dumonts,
unaware of the accident, were now over the brow and out
of sight. George had almost pulled his trigger, when
the Pawnee who had been riding near him galloped
between him and the bull. The little Indian horse,
more used to climbing than the heavily-built hacks
of the white men, shot up the slope like a chamois, and,
joining his whinny to the rider&rsquo;s howl, flew between
the prostrate man and the bull.</p>
<p>Fred, who had been too unnerved for the moment to
do anything but try feebly to roll away out of danger,
was conscious suddenly of a good deal of clattering
close to him; then, looking up, he saw that the bull
had turned to flee and that the shaft of an arrow was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_188' name='page_188'></a>188</span>
protruding from his ribs. The bull was struggling up
the hill, too startled and confused to attempt to battle
with his new assailant, who, in hot pursuit, was sending
a second arrow after the first.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no; hang it; let the redskin finish him,&rdquo; said
Dumont as Coke made ready to fire again.</p>
<p>The bull did not require much more &ldquo;finishing.&rdquo;
Already the Indian had wounded him in two places
and was getting a third arrow ready for him; and the
final rush up-hill, together with loss of blood, was
weakening him at every step. The mustang, not to be
outraced, was soon abreast of him; and one more
arrow from the persevering Indian brought the luckless
beast on to his knees.</p>
<p>Mr. Coke and his friend saw and shot a good many
bisons after that, but never again one that so nearly
turned their trip into a tragedy.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV</h2>
<h3>HOW THE YO-SEMITE VALLEY WAS DISCOVERED</h3>
</div>
<p>Till 1851, the peaks and valleys of the Californian
Sierra Nevada were known only as a grim,
mysterious region that white men, who valued
their lives, would do well not to pry into. Parties of
diggers travelling westwards had crossed the range in
certain places, but even the strongest bands of them
carried their lives in their hands in so doing, for the
Snake Indians regarded the whole neighbourhood as
their special property. All that was definitely known
was that, between the hills, lay deep, uninviting valleys,
walled and overhung with granite blocks. The deepest
and most picturesque of these, the Yo-Semite, was the
great stronghold of the Indian banditti; a cunningly
hidden natural fortress whose approaches no stranger
would suspect; and it was only by sheer accident that
white men ever discovered it.</p>
<p>Only too often, &ldquo;civilisation&rdquo; has been another
name for importing white men&rsquo;s most degrading vices
into a country whose people could originally have
taught the civilisers many a lesson in dignified humility
and self-restraint. And in no instance is this more
true than in that of the Snake or Shoshonean branch
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_190' name='page_190'></a>190</span>
of the Indian race; for whereas, in 1805, the worst
complaints that Captains Lewis and Clarke<a name='FNanchor_n0003' id='FNanchor_n0003'></a><a href='#Footnote_n0003' class='fnanchor'>[3]</a> had to
make of them was that they were treacherous and
given to pilfering, by 1851 they had already become
drunken, lazy highway robbers and gamblers; and
for this the white gold-seekers were largely to blame.</p>
<p>On account of the rush of the &ldquo;forty-niners,&rdquo; San
Francisco and Sacramento had developed, all in five
minutes, from mere Spanish market-villages into
great, raw, ugly towns or camps, whose principal
buildings were drinking and gaming dens and money-brokers&rsquo;
offices. The Indians stood by and watched,
and wondered; and then coveted; for a vulgar
tawdriness, that soon became positively idiotic, was to
them a world of magnificence&mdash;and the gold which paid
for it all was derived from their own soil; a wealth
which they ought to have been enjoying! They
went back to their hill-camps and reported; the
matter was pondered and discussed. They could not
take San Francisco, but at least they could prevent
the white man&rsquo;s territory from spreading beyond certain
limits; and this they determined to do to the
best of their ability.</p>
<p>The strangers most likely to be affected by such an
attitude were those restless spirits who, dissatisfied
with the output of their &ldquo;claims,&rdquo; were already
wandering farther into the unknown country in search
of better ones; and the store and tavern keepers who
supplied travellers and the more outlying diggers. Two
such stores were the property of a young American
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_191' name='page_191'></a>191</span>
named John Savage, a good-hearted, respectable
fellow, who, because he was wise enough to ignore little
thefts on the part of his Indian neighbours, yet man
enough to hit out uncompromisingly if necessary, was
very popular among the redskins; and this popularity
he increased by marrying an Indian girl. He, his wife,
and his mother conducted the store at Mariposa Creek,
while that on the Frezno River was left in charge of a
manager and two assistants.</p>
<p>Every evening a crowd of Snake Indians would collect
outside Savage&rsquo;s house, or in the store, and while
he smoked a friendly pipe with them, he was sometimes
able to gauge their feelings towards the fresh
inhabitants of the tiny settlement, whose number was
steadily increasing. The chief of the Snakes was one
José Jerez, a comparatively young man, who certainly
had not benefited by contact with white men. Bit by
bit this brave had succeeded in supplying most of his
tribe with muskets; but ammunition was not so easy
to obtain. Savage had, from the beginning, firmly refused
to supply the Indians with powder; and now
that San Francisco was becoming a power in the land,
few of them dared enter it to make purchases, lest some
of their tribe&rsquo;s recent depredations should be visited on
them. Thus Jerez was dependent on what ammunition
he could bully or steal or wheedle from passing
travellers or raw new-comers.</p>
<p>One evening Savage noticed that the group of idlers
were less chatty and civil than usual; in fact, they
pointedly conversed with one another in their own
dialect, of which they knew him to be ignorant, instead
of in the broken English which they generally employed.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_192' name='page_192'></a>192</span>
This so aroused his suspicions that he ordered
his wife to play the part of eavesdropper, and to report
anything of a dangerous nature.</p>
<p>The talk turned on the Indians&rsquo; grievances, real or
imaginary. Their fishing and hunting had been encroached
upon, they said; the pale-faces were enriching
themselves out of land that belonged to them,
and giving them nothing in return; not so much as
a bag of gunpowder; and the miners would never be
satisfied till they had driven them up to the barren
mountain-tops.</p>
<p>When Savage had learned the gist of the conversation,
his mind was soon made up. He had to drive
into San Francisco on the following day for fresh
stores, and it occurred to him that if he offered Jerez
a seat in his waggon, and a day&rsquo;s sight-seeing, he would
not only be restoring the chief to good humour, but
would have an opportunity of showing that gentleman
the numerical strength of the white men, and the
folly of interfering with people who might deal out
some very unwelcome chastisement.</p>
<p>Jerez and another brave joyfully accepted the invitation,
and at daybreak the waggon drove off. On the
way Savage did his best, by means of quiet hints, to
show his two guests that it is always wise to put up
with what one cannot alter; and that Indian notions
of wholesale bloodshed would not &ldquo;pay&rdquo; with white
men. In San Francisco he hammered this lesson home
by taking them to see the volunteers at target-practice,
and pointing out one or two pieces of artillery that had
been imported. The chiefs were decidedly impressed,
and, seeing them in such a satisfactory frame of mind,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_193' name='page_193'></a>193</span>
Savage conducted them to the inn where he purposed
staying the night and went about his purchases.</p>
<p>Left to themselves, each found the dollar which
Savage had given him burning a hole in his pocket.
Not daring to venture into the streets by themselves,
they spent the money at the bar, and so effectually
that, when their entertainer returned, both were very
drunk and very quarrelsome. Savage remonstrated
mildly, whereupon both grew abusive and threatening.
In order to avoid an unpleasant scene, he went down
the yard to the outbuilding where he was to sleep;
but before he had lain down, both redskins sought him
out for a renewal of the argument. Savage pointed to
the apartment reserved for them, and recommended
them to go to it; and their answer was a further
torrent of threats, which they emphasised by brandishing
their knives. No one with the spirit of a man in him
cares to see a knife brought into a discussion or fight;
John Savage expressed his personal views on the matter
by hammering both his antagonists with his fists till
they were glad to retreat to their bedroom.</p>
<p>In the morning they were sullen and silent, but
Savage took no notice of this; he finished his marketing,
and then returned to the inn to put in his horses
and take up the Indians. Still they would not speak,
and, disliking their demeanour, the Yankee very
ostentatiously loaded a pair of pistols with ball, and
stuck them in his belt before joining the others on the
front-board. At a house a mile or two out of the town
he stopped to deliver a parcel; he was not away from
the waggon five minutes, but when he returned, Jerez
and his companion had vanished.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_194' name='page_194'></a>194</span></div>
<p>Savage was aghast, for there was but one construction
to be placed upon their disappearance: they
wanted to reach Mariposa Creek before him. For
what purpose would scarcely bear thinking of. They
were familiar with every inch of the country, while he
only knew the cart-track&mdash;a road cut purposely zigzag
that the worst of the hills might be avoided; the
average rate of his horses could hardly exceed six
miles an hour on such a road, while the Indians could
easily run eight; he had thirty miles to drive, and
ought to give the horses at least one rest; they had
scarcely eighteen miles before them, if they went in a
straight line, and would easily accomplish in three
hours a journey that usually took him six.</p>
<p>He lashed the horses without mercy; already he
was picturing his wife and mother killed, and his home
in flames; for the Indians would probably reach
Mariposa in the early afternoon, a time when no
diggers would be likely to be within a mile of the store.
He gave no further thought to food for himself, or bait
or rest for the horses. Twice he saw, or fancied that he
saw, two figures hurrying over the hills to the southeast;
he only drove the harder, trying might and
main to sit on his fears and laugh at himself for being
frightened of a couple of redskins. Unhappily, he knew
all too well that it was not just &ldquo;a couple of redskins&rdquo;
who had to be taken into account. During the past
six months, seven such stores as his had been plundered
and burnt by a strong posse of Snakes; and Jerez
could, without difficulty, collect the best part of a
hundred men at an hour&rsquo;s notice.</p>
<p>Hours and miles slipped by; the horses behaved
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_195' name='page_195'></a>195</span>
like bricks, never once stumbling and apparently never
tiring. As always happens in such a case, the last mile
seemed as long as all the rest together; the road here
was a steady wind, so that the driver could never see
more than a hundred yards ahead of him; for on
either side of the track was dense forest. At last he
came in sight of his home, and then, like a boy, he
stood up on the footboard and vented his feelings
in a delighted &ldquo;Hurrah!&rdquo; For everything was in
its normal condition; the cattle and horses grazing
in the pound; the poultry in the roadway, and his
women-folk gossiping cheerily with a couple of diggers
under the verandah.</p>
<p>So far nothing had been heard of the Indians, and,
after a rest and a meal, Savage began to feel heartily
ashamed of his terrors. But, that night, either a remarkable
coincidence or a very ominous event took
place. For the first time in two years, the store was
entirely deserted by Indians; not a single Shoshonee
looked in for an evening&rsquo;s chat. The next night it was
the same, and the next after that. On the fourth night
the proprietor arrived at a conclusion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a boycott,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;and I&rsquo;m not sorry a little
bit; we shall be better off without &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe they&rsquo;ve boycotted the country as well as
the store,&rdquo; said a loitering digger. &ldquo;For none of our
boys have clapped eyes on a Injun since you come
back from &rsquo;Frisco.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So much the better; &rsquo;cause to-morrow&rsquo;s audit day,
and the old lady goes to the river for her little jaunt.&rdquo;
On the first of every month, either Savage or his mother
drove over to the store at Frezno River to examine
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_196' name='page_196'></a>196</span>
accounts, pay wages, and bring back the &ldquo;takings.&rdquo;
On this occasion the young man felt himself in an awkward
dilemma; on the one hand dreading to be absent
from his store, on the other not at all satisfied that his
mother might not be attacked on the way by revengeful
Indians.</p>
<p>The old lady, however, always looked forward to
such an outing as a welcome break in the monotony of
her life at the Creek, and would not be baulked of her
treat; though, in the morning, she consented to take
Sam, a reliable negro servant, as escort. The Frezno
River store was but a four hours&rsquo; drive distant; and
she ought to be able to return soon after dark came on,
at latest.</p>
<p>In the middle of the day a digger rushed excitedly
into the store. He had just returned from a &ldquo;claim&rdquo;
six miles away, whither he had gone to compare some
quartz.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s all the boys? Not knocked off for the
noon spell yet?&rdquo; he cried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some of &rsquo;em&rsquo;ll soon be round,&rdquo; said Savage, who
was alone in the store. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the trouble?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Trouble &rsquo;nough. The redskins have come down
on First Creek, killed a dozen of &rsquo;em, and cleared out
with all the powder an&rsquo; nuggets they could see their
way to handling.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Savage turned pale; First Creek was on the direct
road to his other store.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are they got to now?&rdquo; he gasped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lord knows. It was a nigger as told me, just afore
he died; he seen it all, an&rsquo; got one o&rsquo; their bullets into
him. All the rest of the diggers have made tracks for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_197' name='page_197'></a>197</span>
&rsquo;Frisco, to fetch out the volunteers. Never had a
chance, so the nigger said. There was &rsquo;most three
hundred o&rsquo; the reptiles, an&rsquo; not more&rsquo;n twenty of our
boys, an&rsquo; all of &rsquo;em took by surprise; shot down afore
they could pick up their guns.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Savage gave the frightened man a drink of spirits,
then said resolutely:</p>
<p>&ldquo;See an&rsquo; muster as many o&rsquo; the boys as ye can.&mdash;Here
come some of &rsquo;em. Tell the others if they don&rsquo;t
wipe off this score, our lives won&rsquo;t be worth a cent out
here. My poor old mother&rsquo;s over at the other store,
and I&rsquo;m off to fetch her back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Within half an hour fifty diggers had been collected,
and, after a brief discussion, it was arranged that forty
of them should accompany Savage on horseback while
the others guarded the store, which, just now, was less
likely to be attacked than the more distant one.</p>
<p>Riding at full gallop they accomplished the distance
in a little over two hours; and even that was two hours
too late. A roar of futile anger arose from the miners
as they pulled up their horses. The store was in
flames, and already half consumed; at the end, by
the stables, was Savage&rsquo;s van, minus the horses, and
across the front-board of it lay the faithful black, shot
dead, but still clutching a discharged rifle; while
round about the doorway were the bodies of the
manager, his two assistants, and old Mrs. Savage.
Heedless of everything else, her son rushed to her side;
then uttered a strange little cry of relief as she opened
her eyes and sat up painfully. Blood was running from
her shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank God you are safe,&rdquo; he said huskily. &ldquo;The
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_198' name='page_198'></a>198</span>
rest doesn&rsquo;t matter so much now.&rdquo; He lifted her in
his arms and carried her tenderly to the waggon.
Meanwhile, some of his companions were examining
the other bodies for some sign of life, which, unhappily,
was not forthcoming; while the rest made
fruitless efforts at extinguishing the fire.</p>
<p>The old lady&rsquo;s story was soon told. She had not been
in the store very long when a large party of Indians
swooped down on the place with guns, tomahawks, and
lighted torches. She heard a scream from the negro
who had been dozing under the waggon-tilt, and she
and the three shopmen rushed to the door, only to be
shot down immediately by the crowd of shrieking
wretches outside. She had received a ball in the
shoulder, and, while the Indians were ransacking and
firing the store, swooned away from fright and loss of
blood.</p>
<p>A pair of horses were at once put into the shafts and
the sorrowful party were about to return to Mariposa
Creek, when a dozen horsemen galloped up; miners
from the &ldquo;claim&rdquo; hard by, who, though they had paid
no special heed to the firing, had soon been alarmed
by the smoke of the burning house. Not one of them
had seen anything of the Shoshonees, and all were
anxious to help in a search for the culprits. But the
short winter&rsquo;s day was already at an end, and Savage
preferred getting his mother home in safety to scouring
a country that might teem with Indian ambuscades;
he therefore urged the volunteers to make a dash for
San Francisco, to interview the Governor (McDougall)
and ask for troops and ammunition.</p>
<p>But the day&rsquo;s misadventures were not yet ended.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_199' name='page_199'></a>199</span>
Within a mile of Mariposa Creek the returning men
could hear spasmodic bursts of musketry fire.</p>

<span class='smcap'>Red Indian Attack on a Store</span><br />
<br />
The Indians swooped down on the place with guns, tomahawks, and lighted torches. Those within rushed to the door, only to be shot down immediately by a crowd of wild redskins outside.<br />
</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re laying up for us, by gum!&rdquo; said one man,
starting off at a gallop.</p>
<p>Savage leapt from the waggon and on to a spare
horse, and, leaving his mother to the care of two or
three men who were riding inside, he started with the
rest for the store. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got them this time,&rdquo; he
shouted triumphantly.</p>
<p>About seventy redskins, most of them on horseback,
and the rest with their horses tethered close at hand,
were firing on the house, though from a tolerably safe
distance; for the undaunted miners within had a good
supply of ammunition, whereas the Snakes had to use
theirs sparingly. Already a good many Indians lay
dead or wounded, and, at the sound made by the new
arrivals, the rest either turned to bay or fled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say I didn&rsquo;t warn you, Jerez,&rdquo; shouted
Savage as he charged at the chief and fired off his pistol
in his face.</p>
<p>Seeing their leader down, the Indians hesitated,
though some of the bolder of them rode straight for the
store, now that it was no longer safe for the men inside
to continue their fire. But the ensuing battle was only
a very short one. However brave the Indians might
be at shooting from cover, or making war on women,
they were powerless in open field against the burly
miners, who cared nothing for their howls and their
hatchets, and who, in many cases, having exhausted
their ammunition, tore the savages screaming from
their saddles and flung them senseless on the hard-frozen
road.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_200' name='page_200'></a>200</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Look what the oseberds be at, Savage!&rdquo; roared
a huge Devonshireman, spurring his horse furiously in
pursuit of a small batch of Indians who were galloping
for the hills.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After &rsquo;em,&rdquo; echoed the defenders of the store; and
Savage and five others rode madly in the Devonshireman&rsquo;s
wake.</p>
<p>Confident of success now that their friends had returned,
the miners in the store had come out to continue
the fight in the open; and the young Indian
wife had followed them. In an instant, and at first
unseen by anyone except Billy West the Devonshireman,
one of the braves had snatched up the woman,
flung her across his saddle, and ridden off, his flight
covered by other fugitives.</p>
<p>The little handful of white men rode despairingly
on, though their horses were jaded, though it was
pitch dark and a heavy snow was beginning. There
was no thought of ambuscades now; each man&rsquo;s blood
was up; each man ready to deal with a score of
Indians single-handed. Yet, at last, common sense
said &ldquo;stop.&rdquo; For the first mile or so, the snow had
been their friend; for, to eyes accustomed to darkness,
the Indians&rsquo; track was visible enough on its surface;
but with the increasing storm, footprints were obliterated
as fast as they were made. The Devonshireman
was the first to pull up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall us goo on, or goo back, or baide yere,&mdash;or
what?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>Everyone looked towards Savage. Clearly these
good fellows were all anxiety to show their sympathy
with him, and their readiness to fall in with his least
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_201' name='page_201'></a>201</span>
wish. He, too, had now pulled up, but seemed altogether
too dazed to form any decision. The others held
a whispered council; but, while they still hesitated,
they heard a body of mounted men riding swiftly
behind them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Halt!&mdash;Who goes there?&rdquo; And as an echo to
the leader&rsquo;s voice, came the click of three dozen
carbine-hammers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right; <em>we</em> shan&rsquo;t eat ye,&rdquo; growled a miner; and
the troop rode on towards them. &ldquo;Who are <em>you</em>, any
way?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dr. Bunnell, and forty volunteers from &rsquo;Frisco.
Know anything about that affair at First Creek this
morning?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The new arrivals were mounted militia from San
Francisco, who had been warned by the fugitives from
the massacre at the diggings. Billy West began to tell
of the other outrages, but the doctor interrupted him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay; we judged there was something of the sort
going on. Bring that redskin here again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Two men with bull&rsquo;s-eye lanterns at their belts rode
forward, leading a third horse on which an Indian was
securely bound.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s our guide,&rdquo; said Dr. Bunnell grimly. He
held up his heavy stock-whip to the lantern light, and
the Shoshonee winced. &ldquo;We captured him this afternoon,
and he&rsquo;s going to be good enough to show us
where his brothers live. We got ten of &rsquo;em altogether;
Captain Boling&rsquo;s men are looking after the rest.
They&rsquo;ll meet us yon side the first hill at midnight; so
fall in with our lads, and we&rsquo;ll get on; if your horses
are anything like ours, you&rsquo;ll be glad to travel slowly.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_202' name='page_202'></a>202</span></div>
<p>The troop rode on silently, following the directions
given by the prisoner; and soon after midnight they
came upon a body of men, seventy strong, who, having
dismounted, were huddling over camp-fires on the
mountain-side. The soldiers were well supplied with
rations, which they readily shared with Savage and
his six friends; and all settled down to give the
horses a breathing space. A couple of hours before
dawn, a bugle blew, and the shivering, stiffened men
clambered into their saddles again.</p>
<p>The way now lay across a snow-clad plain which,
after a few miles, began to slope steadily upwards.
As day broke, the riders saw a group of hills not far
ahead; and at sight of them the Indians began to
look hesitating and uncomfortable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo; asked Captain Boling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They can&rsquo;t agree, gov&rsquo;nor,&rdquo; said a man who acted
as interpreter. &ldquo;Some of &rsquo;em allow we&rsquo;re on the wrong
track altogether.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In other words, they reckon we&rsquo;re in for the worst
of it, and they&rsquo;ll get burnt for informing,&rdquo; said Dr.
Bunnell, riding up. He spoke impressively in the
Shoshonean dialect to the prisoners for a minute, then
added, &ldquo;All right; drive on. I&rsquo;ve made them understand
that it won&rsquo;t answer their purpose to be crooked
with us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>More crestfallen than ever, the guides led the way up
the slope and into an unsuspected ravine, which eventually
opened on to another plain; and this they
crossed, coming out presently to the brink of a sharp
downward slope, at the foot of which the opening of a
valley was visible.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_203' name='page_203'></a>203</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s someone standing over there.&rdquo; Captain
Boling pointed to the mouth of the valley.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay; Injun woman,&rdquo; said a sharp-eyed miner.</p>
<p>As the men quickened their pace the woman ran to
meet them. It was an old Indian squaw, who was
wringing her hands in an agony of terror. Dr. Bunnell
reined up and questioned her, and she at once admitted
that a strange Indian girl had been brought to
the valley a few hours earlier, and that over two hundred
Indians were sheltering there. She also told him what
he did not believe at the time, but which subsequently
proved to be true: that these would be the first white
men to enter the valley. He looked sharply round at
the prisoners; their faces fully confirmed the old
woman&rsquo;s betrayal of their tribe&rsquo;s hiding-place.</p>
<p>At the sound of the bugle the whole troop dashed
into the valley, and the first sight that greeted them
was a large group of wigwams. Before the savages
could get into battle array their camp was surrounded,
and a brisk carbine fire had opened on them. Almost
at the first shot they lost heart, and on seeing them lay
down their arms, the Captain stopped the firing and
ordered his men to close in. John Savage, unable to
control himself any longer, made a rush for the wigwams;
and, while he looked desperately round him, his
wife, screaming deliriously, came running to meet him.</p>
<p>Through this prompt action on the part of the
militia, the Indian rising was entirely suppressed, over
a hundred braves were carried back to San Francisco
as hostages, and the beautiful Yo-Semite Valley
ceased, from that day, to be the stronghold <a name='TC_2'></a><ins class="trchange" title="Was 'off'">of</ins> Shoshonee

<h2>CHAPTER XVI</h2>
<h3>AMONG THE NIQUIRANS AND APACHES</h3>
</div>
<p>A somewhat adventurous career fell to the lot
of the late Julius Froebel, a nephew of the great
Friedrich Froebel of &ldquo;Kindergarten&rdquo; fame.
Having devoted his early manhood to journalism and
politics of a very rabid and revolutionary character,
he became the recognised leader of the Dresden democratic
party in 1848. After being arrested in Austria
and reprieved from a death-sentence, he fled to New
York, and was for some time the editor of a German
paper published there.</p>
<p>Two years later he joined a party of traders who
were sailing for Central America, and with these he
stayed for some months at Granada, on Lake Nicaragua.
Finding town life becoming tame to him, he one
day started off by himself to examine the more inland
district, which was then inhabited largely by Indian
tribes. The project had been in his mind for a long
time, and what finally decided him was the accidental
meeting with a fellow countryman, who told him
privately that gold had just been found in large quantities
at a village a little farther west; so without a
guide, without more than one day&rsquo;s provisions, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_205' name='page_205'></a>205</span>
with only a very scanty knowledge of Spanish to help
him on his way, he set off on his risky trip.</p>
<p>He travelled all that day, and met no one after he
had left the outskirts of the town; and that night, with
his saddle for a pillow, he slept very comfortably under
a tree. On the next day, he continued his way till an
easy ride of about twelve miles, across a pathless
plain, brought him suddenly on the heels of a travelling
party of fifty Indians,&mdash;men, women, and children&mdash;all
of them chatting freely and jubilantly, and riding
as though bent upon some definite errand. They
saluted him cheerily and he asked, in his broken
Spanish, how far he was from the next village.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is over there; not far; not very far.&rdquo; He
looked where they were pointing and saw that smoke
was rising thinly from beyond a clump of trees.
&ldquo;Keep with us, Señor, and we will show you the
way,&rdquo; added the man, who seemed to be the chief or
leader.</p>
<p>But this village proved to be a great deal farther
than it looked; riding among the trees and thick undergrowth
was slow and weary work, and, even in this
damp, shaded spot, the heat was now becoming almost
unendurable. The Indians themselves were
losing their energy and talkativeness; and many of
them were beginning to lag behind or fall asleep in
their saddles, when the chief cried out that they would
halt at the little stream which was already in sight.</p>
<p>Froebel, more than willing, dismounted with the
rest, and, tethering his horse to a tree, sought a comfortable
resting-place for himself. Hunger and fatigue
not infrequently go hand in hand, and the sight of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_206' name='page_206'></a>206</span>
Indian women collecting sticks to feed the fires which
they had speedily made reminded the traveller not
only that it was some hours since he had breakfasted,
but that, beyond a flask of brandy and water, all his
provisions were exhausted. He watched wistfully the
Indians&rsquo; preparations. What were they going to eat?</p>
<p>Two women near him were untying their bundles,
and now produced therefrom a number of small
drinking-gourds, nets of eggs, bunches of plantains,
with oranges or other fruit, which Froebel eyed
hungrily. Then, to his great relief, he saw that he was
to be regarded as one of the family; for two young
Indians, sons of the chief, at once helped him generously
to the fruit, and explained that the great cooking-pots
that hung over one or other of the fires would soon
be filled with eggs, of which he would be expected to
eat his share.</p>
<p>When the eggs were &ldquo;done,&rdquo; the water used for
boiling them, instead of being thrown away, was
economically employed for cocoa-making; irregular,
greasy-looking blocks of sweetened chocolate being
thrown into the pot, which a woman stirred with a
stick till it was a thick, boiling paste; and into this
each person dipped his or her gourd.</p>
<p>The meal being ended, the men lay and smoked long
cheroots, and recommenced their light-hearted gabble
of the morning. Froebel intimated that he was willing
to pay for his meal, but the Indians stoutly refused his
offer of money, and with such an air of gentle reproach
that he began to feel as small as though he had asked
for a bill after dining at a friend&rsquo;s table. Something of
the dignity of manner of their Spanish conquerors
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_207' name='page_207'></a>207</span>
seemed to have descended to these Indians; though
they were far from holding themselves aloof from
their guest, or from making any secret of their own
affairs, not one of them ventured to ask the German
a single question as to his coming or his going. They
told him that they were Niquirans&mdash;a wandering,
gypsy-like tribe of the Nahuatlan stock; and that, as
they had heard of the discovery of a gold-mine at the
village which they were approaching, where everyone
might go and help himself, they thought&mdash;being in
the neighbourhood&mdash;they might as well bring away a
few sackfuls of the metal.</p>
<p>The journalist pricked up his ears. El Dorado,
Tom Tiddler&rsquo;s Ground, was not a fable after all, then?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are there any white men there?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>The chief of the Niquirans smiled. He was a great
deal too polite to say that, had there been, the gold
would not be there long, but that was what his smile
seemed to imply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have heard of none as yet, Señor; but we did
not know of the gold till this morning. The village, as
you perceive, is quite away from any main road, and
ordinarily there is nothing to bring white men in this
direction.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When all had rested sufficiently, the journey was resumed,
and a short ride brought them into the village,
which was as deserted as &ldquo;sweet Auburn&rdquo; itself. Not
so much as a dog was in evidence; but the murmur of
voices in the little valley beyond was a sufficient
guide to the quarter where the inhabitants had collected.
Very soon the gold-seekers came upon these,
three or four hundred of them, encamped between a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_208' name='page_208'></a>208</span>
stream and a small bluff; and, round this, horses,
mules, ox-waggons, and tents were drawn up in the
form of a crescent.</p>
<p>No sooner did the new-comers show their faces than
the villagers, who seemed to have been taking their
siesta, rose up and armed themselves with stones or
sticks, and some few even with bows and spears.</p>
<p>The Niquirans drew up hesitatingly, and Froebel,
dismounting, approached the threatening crowd with
every sign of friendliness. He asked to see the chief,
and, on being taken before him, demanded to know
the cause of such a hostile reception.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have found a gold-mine here,&rdquo; said the chief,
&ldquo;and our people at first mistook your party for unfriendly
Indians who might have come to drive us away
from it.&rdquo; He went on to say, with delightful frankness,
that the villagers intended removing as much of the
gold as possible, and that, as soon as their own claims
were satisfied, anyone would be welcome to what remained.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But <em>will</em> there be any remaining?&rdquo; asked Froebel,
with an incredulous smile. &ldquo;There are many of my
people who would gladly give you money and cattle
in exchange for your gold. You had better show me
your mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The chief eyed him with some amount of suspicion,
discussed the matter with one or two cronies for a few
minutes, and at last invited the stranger to &ldquo;come and
see.&rdquo; Following his conductors through the line of
vehicles, animals, and babies that marked off the
precious spot, Froebel came to the bluff-face, at which
one or two of the more zealous Indians were now beginning
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_209' name='page_209'></a>209</span>
work again. He had been prepared to see
nothing but quartz, or possibly a few grains of the
metal mingled with sand; therefore he was fain to
stand still and rub his eyes when he beheld a broad
golden stratum in the cliff on which the sunrays flashed
as on a looking-glass. It was a sight that would have
made the least covetous of mortals gasp.</p>
<p>The chief pointed proudly to a row of bushel-baskets,
piled to the brim with the glittering substance,
and intimated that, since the white stranger&rsquo;s intentions
were peaceable, he was at liberty to fill his
pockets.</p>
<p>There are some white men who, when they have an
unpalatable truth to disclose, do not trouble to choose
a tasteful or tactful or kind method of performing the
task; and it is to be feared that Herr Froebel was one
of these. He knew little about metallurgy, but one
glance at the shining lump that he took from the
nearest basket told him that the &ldquo;gold&rdquo; was pyrites,
worth perhaps twopence a cart-load. To the amazement
of the Indians he flung it contemptuously away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s no gold; it&rsquo;s rubbish; worth nothing,&rdquo; he
blurted out.</p>
<p><em>Not gold?</em> But not an Indian believed him; not one
of them could see anything but jealousy or intentional
insult in this frank piece of information; and the chief
and his followers turned threateningly upon him. One
and another took up the cry, and Froebel, who had left
his only pistol in his holster, fancied that he saw death
staring him in the face; for the excitement that he
had created in the little community could not be
quelled by a man who only knew about a thousand
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_210' name='page_210'></a>210</span>
words of the language. He dodged between two
mules and into the open; but the crowd of loiterers
there had already invented another version of his
crime; he was running off with their gold! There
was nothing for it but pure and undisguised flight, and
he set off as fast as his legs could carry him to the
spot where the Niquirans were awaiting him. Sticks,
stones, and mud whizzed about his head, and he could
hear swift feet pursuing him.</p>
<p>Luckily, it was a time of day when no Indian, however
fleet of foot, will run very far or fast; his pursuers
turned out to be only some mischievous boys who were
not going to throw away an opportunity of pelting a
fugitive; and, at sight of the grim-looking Niquiran
horsemen, who began to move a step or two forward,
even these returned to their camp. Mounting his horse
again, Froebel looked back and saw that the
villagers were making ready to repel any advance of
the strangers; they were again collecting their
weapons and shouting defiance at the Niquirans.
Doubtless these would have had a very easy victory;
for they were better armed and infinitely finer men, in
the habit of fighting at a moment&rsquo;s notice; while the
simple villagers had had no quarrel with their neighbours
for a quarter of a century.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is nothing to fight about; it was all my
fault,&rdquo; said Froebel; and he hastily explained the
whole matter.</p>
<p>His companions laughed, and turned their horses&rsquo;
heads; they were happy-go-lucky, hand-to-mouth
folk, to whom the disappointment was far less bitter
than to the German; and they rode away cheerily
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_211' name='page_211'></a>211</span>
enough, leaving the gold-diggers to bask in their happy
ignorance.</p>
<p>As he had nothing better to do, Froebel threw in his
lot with the wanderers, and, in this manner, spent
many happy months in seeing the country. But, to
a man of his restless disposition, even this roving life
became wearisome; he returned to Granada and there
fell in again with two of the Yankee traders with whom
he had arrived. For the next year or so he travelled
with them, visiting almost every town in Central
America; and at last decided to return with them to
the States by way of Mexico.</p>
<p>Mexico, as will be seen in a later chapter, was in a
state of great unrest at this time (1853); and, in the
wilder parts, it was unsafe for white men to travel
without escort; but, as troops of soldiers were often
scouring the country, the three strangers relied on
being able to travel with one or other of these. They
had a pleasant ride through Guatemala, visited the
wonderful ruins at Uxmal in Yucatan: ruins nearly a
thousand years old, that tell practically all that can be
told of the civilisation of the ancient Mexicans; and at
length entered upon the longer and more perilous portion
of their trip.</p>
<p>But fortune was more favourable to them than to
the generality of Mexican travellers in those days; for
they covered the long journey, of over a thousand
miles, from the frontier to Chihuahua in North Mexico,
without a single misadventure. While in this city,
Froebel discovered, first that he was leading too uneventful
a life for his constitution, and secondly, that
his purse was now empty, for while his companions
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_212' name='page_212'></a>212</span>
had been ants, he had been a cricket. It happened
that the Mexican Commander-in-Chief, General Trias,
was going north to put down a rising, and Froebel
obtained from him the post of temporary transport-agent;
he was to follow the troops with ten waggons
and a hundred mules, and assist generally in the commissariat.</p>
<p>Every day, from the time of starting, horrible reports
of atrocities committed by the Apache Indians
reached him. In one place, fourteen women and
children had been slaughtered; in another, a flock of
sheep had been stolen and the shepherds killed; while
in a third, the prairie had been deliberately set on fire
at a time when the wind could not fail to carry the
flames to a cluster of huts, many of whose occupants
were burned to death. Yet the soldiers could not so
much as get a sight of the culprits, who, on their fleet
horses, made nothing of covering fifty miles in a few
hours.</p>
<p>But one night, when Froebel and his muleteers were
encamped some few hundred yards behind the main
body, a volley of musketry sounded close at hand;
and an attendant, who was in the act of handing the
transport agent his supper, fell dead. The muleteers
snatched up brands from the fire for torches, and, gun
in hand, ran in search of the enemy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shoot; shoot,&rdquo; cried Froebel, himself setting the
example by firing at a group of shadowy figures that
were already on the move. But it was too late; the
Indians could be heard scampering away across
the prairie. The agent dared not take his men in
pursuit, leaving the mules unguarded; but he rode
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_213' name='page_213'></a>213</span>
across to the cavalry tents where General Trias and
twenty men, who had heard the firing, were already
in the saddle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fall in with us, then, as you know the direction in
which they went,&rdquo; said Trias hurriedly; and away
they all galloped.</p>
<p>Far away across the plain they could hear the regular
beat of the fleeing horses&rsquo; hoofs. Without stopping,
Trias gave the command to fire; the twenty carbines
went off like one, and, from the sudden wild screaming
ahead of them, Froebel knew that some of the bullets
had hit their random mark. This was confirmed in a
minute or so when, in the clouded and uncertain light
of the moon, he caught sight of three Indians and a
horse lying on the ground as the troop swept past.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There they are; load again,&rdquo; shouted Trias; and
all could see the feather head-dresses of the Apaches
waving in the breeze, still within gunshot. But the
next volley took no apparent effect, the shapes were
growing dimmer again, and the sounds less distinct.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On; on; we must have them,&rdquo; shouted the
General; and, as the horses were tolerably fresh, the
task was still not hopeless.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hark! They have reached the road,&rdquo; cried one
of the soldiers, who was perfectly familiar with the
neighbourhood. This was the high road to the Texan
frontier, in places a mere sand-strip bordered on either
side by forests, in others a smooth, well-beaten track
bisecting a vast prairie. The news was the reverse of
good, for now the Apaches might at any moment
separate, and disappear among the trees. The forest
part of the road wound very considerably, so that the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_214' name='page_214'></a>214</span>
pursuers would no longer be able to profit by the light
of the already setting moon.</p>
<p>Half an hour went by; an hour; and still the
Mexicans rode on, now certain that they heard the
Indians&rsquo; horses, now equally certain that all of them
had dispersed over the prairie or in the woods. But
all of a sudden a faint scream sounded along the road,
together with the undeniable tramp of horses. The
scream came nearer, and the soldiers spurred their
breathless chargers round the bend of the road.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are lights,&rdquo; shouted Froebel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; carriage-lamps; they have stopped the
mail-coach,&rdquo; roared Trias. &ldquo;Keep it up, my men;
we must have them now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, they are running to meet us,&rdquo; said Froebel;
&ldquo;they must have been reinforced.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The lights were certainly coming nearer, and, with
them, a body of horsemen; and now the soldiers could
hear the quick popping of pistol-shots. Then all at
once a loud shout arose from where the lights were,
the sound of wheels came nearer and nearer, but the
accompanying horsemen were obviously riding now in
the other direction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you the soldiers?&rdquo; shouted a chorus of
voices from the coach as it came up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can catch them yet; they tried to stop us
and rob us; and would have done, but for hearing
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The troop did not draw bridle, but wheeled away on
to the prairie in pursuit of half a dozen moving figures
on whom they were easily gaining. A minute later a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_215' name='page_215'></a>215</span>
voice in front cried: &ldquo;All right; we&rsquo;ll give in. Don&rsquo;t
fire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, those are not Indians,&rdquo; said Trias in
astonishment.</p>
<p>Nor were they; they were six Mexican brigands
who had been pursuing the mail; the Apaches were
probably safe long ago, in one of their forest camps.
The highwaymen were soon seized and bound, and as
it was ultimately discovered that they were some of
the revolutionaries for whom Trias was on the look-out,
the night-ride was not altogether a wild-goose
chase.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII</h2>
<h3>ACROSS THE UNITED STATES IN A WAGGON</h3>
</div>
<p>From the foregoing chapter it will have been
seen that Mexico, in the middle of the nineteenth
century, was not a neighbourhood
wherein a man might look to find rest and quiet; and
it is safe to say that if any one part of it was less to be
desired than another as a place of resort, it was the
United States frontier.</p>
<p>When the war between Mexico and the United
States ended in 1847, this frontier had to be overhauled
and settled afresh, and within the next two
years Presidents Polk and Taylor appointed a Boundary
Commission. One of the commissioners was the
late John Russell Bartlett, secretary to the New York
Ethnographical Society, and subsequently one of the
greatest authorities on the Indian races.</p>
<p>Mr. Bartlett did not leave New York for his southward
journey till the summer of 1850, and one of
the first lessons that he learned on that journey was
that redskins, like other men, cannot be understood
from books or from mere surface examination. Anxious
to see as much as possible of the Indians of the southern
States, he elected to travel by waggon, there being no
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_217' name='page_217'></a>217</span>
immediate hurry for him to present himself at El Paso.
Such a course meant passing through wild regions of
prairie, plain, and hill, peopled by Missouris, Choctaws,
Bannocks, Comanches, Chicasas, Araphoes, and perhaps
a score more of savage tribes, the majority of
whom still regarded the white man as their natural
enemy; and the details of that ride, with his subsequent
adventures in and round Mexico, would
occupy more than the whole of this book.</p>
<p>His first acquaintance with the Missouri Indians
came about while the waggon was crossing the great
undulating plains near the Arkansas River. He was
seated under the tilt pretending to write letters, but,
in actual fact, dozing off to sleep under the influence of
a sudden spell of heat, when a wild shriek from the
direction of his leaders&rsquo; heads aroused him. He looked
up and found that he was alone, though this was
nothing out of the ordinary; for his negro attendant
and his two waggoners not infrequently got down and
walked when the horses were obliged to move slowly
or when there was an opportunity of filling the pot.
Before he could reach the forepart of the waggon,
the black&rsquo;s curly head showed above the front-board,
eyes bulging and teeth chattering with terror.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look, Massa; look!&rdquo; he shrieked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Catch hold o&rsquo; them ribbons, <em>will</em> ye?&rdquo; he heard
one of the teamsters shout; but the negro was too
paralysed with fear to obey. The next moment the
man who had called out, and had now got possession of
the reins, landed with a flying leap on the footboard,
and was followed with no less precipitation by his
mate.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_218' name='page_218'></a>218</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Gun; quick!&rdquo; panted the second man, while the
first endeavoured to control the frightened horses.</p>
<p>Stumbling over the cowering nigger, Mr. Bartlett
joined the teamsters. The four horses were still shying
violently and kicking in every direction; and, not
fifteen feet from the two wheelers, was a bison, charging
with furious determination straight at them. He
caught up his gun, which hung in slings close to his
hand, and emptied both barrels at the formidable
beast, which fell on his knees, gasping and bellowing,
till two more bullets from the second teamster made
him roll over.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Reckon we&rsquo;ll have some of his meat, when
them hosses have done rearing,&rdquo; said the shooter. It
took time to quiet the terror-stricken creatures, and,
in the end, the driver was forced to give them their
heads for a while; and they had hardly settled to
their normal condition when a fresh incident occurred
to trouble their peace.</p>
<p>A succession of single shouts from various directions
sounded from beyond the hill which they were now
passing, and suddenly swelled into a long, howling,
shrieking chorus that was echoed by maddened
bellowings as from a thousand bulls. With difficulty
the horses allowed themselves to be held in, and as they
were walked past the final spur of the hill, a truly
wonderful sight broke on the spectators. They had
come to the mouth of a pleasant, grassy valley, in the
midst of which a herd of over two hundred bison were
running hither and thither, butting each other, falling
over, or trying furiously to reach the slopes; while,
down the hill on either side, a great troop of mounted
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_219' name='page_219'></a>219</span>
Indians swept like a torrent; spears slung at their
backs, arrows flying from the bows in their hands.
With all the order and method of a cavalry brigade,
they slackened their speed suddenly, and, spreading
out, formed themselves into a huge circle; then
straightway continued with their spears the work of
slaughter which their arrows had begun.</p>
<p>For ever on the move, now to right, now to left, now
charging into the heaving brown mass, they plied their
lances untiringly, time after time avoiding, with no
visible effort, the desperate charge of one or other of
the bisons. To a man who loved sport, but not slaughter,
it was a revolting sight; yet fascinating as well,
by reason of the skill and pertinacity which these
savages displayed in their task of blood. Now and
then one or two energetic bulls would force a way
through some opening in the line, in the fond hope of
being allowed to flee over the hills; but there was
always some vigilant horseman ready to give chase or
else to send half a dozen arrows in rapid succession,
and so to cut short the creature&rsquo;s chance of escape.
Not till every bison lay dead did the redskins stay
their hands or condescend to turn an eye on the onlookers
who had drawn up at the entrance to the
valley.</p>
<p>Bartlett waited with curiosity to see what the
Indians&rsquo; next move would be. As concerned himself
they might be perfectly harmless; already he had
come to the conclusion that the redskin is a very much
maligned man; but, whether harmless or offensive,
the hunters had now caught sight of the waggon, and
to attempt to flee before men, mounted as well as they
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_220' name='page_220'></a>220</span>
were, would only be a ridiculous waste of energy. A
few turned their horses his way, but the great majority
continued to hunt down the game; but whatever work
these had still to do, was very soon done; for, by the
time their brethren had come up with the waggon,
they were following in their wake.</p>
<p>From the teamsters Bartlett learned that the horsemen
were Missouris&mdash;a branch of the Sioux&mdash;and accordingly
he stood up in the waggon and began
hesitatingly to address the foremost in what he
had already mastered of the Siouan dialect. The
effect should have been flattering; they didn&rsquo;t give
him &ldquo;three cheers,&rdquo; their education in that form of
enthusiasm being as yet imperfect; but they smiled
encouragingly and turned their spears points downwards,
while the more demonstrative pressed up to
him, patted his shoulders, his ribs, and his leggings,
telling him that he was a great man, a wise chief, and
a &ldquo;good medicine&rdquo;&mdash;whatever that might mean.</p>
<p>Three men who appeared, from their more ornate
dress, to be rulers among the tribe, now turned and
gave some directions to those who were coming up
behind them; and, as these rode forward, Bartlett
noticed that every man of the division that had stayed
to cut up the carcases carried one or more semi-globular
lumps of bison-beef on his saddle-bow; and
it was to bestow some of these lumps on the
stranger that the chief had called them. In a couple
of minutes the footboard was like a butcher&rsquo;s stall,
for meat enough lay there to feed the four occupants
of the waggon for about a month. On Bartlett&rsquo;s asking
where was the best place to cross the river, a chief told
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_221' name='page_221'></a>221</span>
him there was a ferry fourteen miles farther, to which
the troop would have great pleasure in escorting him.</p>

<p class='caption'>
<span class='smcap'>A Bison Surround</span><br />
<br />
The Indians would surround a herd of bison and wantonly kill every member of it. They would cut off the hump only, leaving the rest of the carcase for wolves and coyotes.<br />
</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;We have finished our hunting for the day, and are
going home to our camp, which is a few miles this side
of the river,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Finished?&rdquo; reiterated Bartlett. &ldquo;Then who is
going to carry the game home?&rdquo; He pointed to the
carcase-crowded valley.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, <em>those</em> are for the coyotes and wolves,&rdquo; said the
oldest chief contemptuously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then why kill so many?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The chief pointed to one of the blocks of meat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is all that we care to eat; and just now we
have no need of hides or hoofs, so we can afford to
leave those.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The meat that had been cut away was just the
&ldquo;hump&rdquo; of the animal; the raised portion of the
withers. In his old age, Mr. Bartlett was not surprised
to hear naturalists and sportsmen bewailing the
scarcity of bisons after what he saw that day, and on
many subsequent occasions. The Indians had surrounded
and slain a whole herd, with the wanton love
of destruction that the child and the savage usually
display. They were in the habit of using the horns for
spear-heads, and the hoofs to make the glue with which
they fixed their arrow-points; but here were enough
horns and glue to equip a dozen regiments of Indians&mdash;and
all left to waste and rot.</p>
<p>The ferry was reached before dark; the Indians
were rewarded with bits of finery, and a plug or two of
tobacco, and went on their way.</p>
<p>As the waggon neared the &ldquo;Llano Estacado,&rdquo;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_222' name='page_222'></a>222</span>
Bartlett began to hear news of redskins who might
not accord him so amiable a reception. At the Red
River tributary of the Mississippi, he was told that
several American travellers had been murdered in the
valleys and passes by Apaches, who were popularly
supposed to be a sort of hired assassins of the Mexicans
at this time. The tidings did not sound encouraging,
but he had now travelled through about twelve
hundred miles of Indian territory without encountering
so much as an angry word or a petty theft, and he
was not prepared to go out of his way on account of a
mere rumour.</p>
<p>He had scarcely crossed the first part of the hill-ridge
that encloses the celebrated Llano, when his
waggon broke down without the least warning. Tools
were got out and the damage examined, and the axle-bar
of the hind wheels was found to be so injured as
to necessitate repairs that would take a good deal of
time.</p>
<p>Jim, the black, had just unharnessed the horses,
and was pegging them down, when one of the teamsters
reported a small batch of Apaches overtaking them, as
though they might have followed the waggon from a
distance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see they all have muskets,&rdquo; commented Bartlett.
&ldquo;That doesn&rsquo;t look promising. We must make as big
a show as we can. Here you, Jim; you must pretend
to be mending the waggon, and we others will stand by
and look as innocent as we can&mdash;but with guns and
pistols ready.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The negro&rsquo;s courage was not remarkable, and this
was a very satisfactory means of keeping him out of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_223' name='page_223'></a>223</span>
the way, for he would be perfectly happy under the
waggon; the teamsters, on the other hand, were men
who had been through the recent war, and cared no
more for Indians than they did for Mexicans. They
and Bartlett picked up their guns, taking care to hold
them as unconcernedly and inoffensively as possible;
but at the same time keeping a sharp eye on the horsemen,
and prepared to fire the moment they saw any of
them inclined to take a preliminary shot at them by
way of greeting.</p>
<p>Perhaps this attitude disconcerted the redskins;
perhaps they had had no evil intentions from the
beginning; at any rate, they rode up harmlessly
enough, asked what was the matter, and offered to act
as guides if the travellers would give them a little
powder and tobacco. While the teamsters betook
themselves to the repairs, Bartlett talked with the
Apaches, questioned them about the way, and told
them smoothly but decisively that he could not part
with any ammunition, though he would give tobacco
and some scarlet cloth. The cloth was received rapturously,
and, as soon as the waggon was mended, the
procession moved on, the Apaches proving very satisfactory
and friendly guides.</p>
<p>At parting, Bartlett gave the chief&mdash;who, by the
way, called himself &ldquo;Mangus Colorado&rdquo;&mdash;an old
overcoat, and his delight, his pride, and his antics
forthwith convulsed the beholders. Months afterwards,
while scouring the valley of the Rio Grande
with Captain Buford and his dragoons, who were
hunting for Indian horse-thieves, the Commissioner
came across Mangus again; he was still wearing the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_224' name='page_224'></a>224</span>
overcoat, though it was a stifling day, and though he
had, all his life, gone naked as far as the waist.</p>
<p>The guides left the waggon at the beginning of the
El Paso road, whence, though the way was rough and
sometimes nearly impassable, there could be no difficulty
in finding the city. On the evening of the following
day, Bartlett, hearing gunshots close at hand, sent
a teamster forward to reconnoitre. The man soon
came running back; some Apaches were besieging a
wayside inn, he said. He mounted to his place and
the horses were whipped up to the gallop.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The more show and noise we make, the better,&rdquo;
remarked the driver as he reached for his gun.</p>
<p>As soon as they were past a belt of boulders they
could see what was taking place. Twelve Indians on
horseback were surrounding the house, while, from
behind a half-shuttered window, a man and a woman
were firing despairingly, though the Apaches were
sheltered from their bullets; no one but these two
seemed to be about the place. As the waggon stopped,
one of the Indians got off his horse and began to batter
at the flimsy door with the stock of his gun. The
second teamster raised his rifle and fired with as much
coolness as if he had been shooting a prairie wolf, and
the redskin fell dead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now they&rsquo;ll make fools of themselves, and get
between two fires. Leastwise they &rsquo;most always do,&rdquo;
he said.</p>
<p>After a moment&rsquo;s hesitation the Indians charged
with a frightful howl at the waggon; but, in so doing,
they brought themselves in full range of the couple
who had been trying to get a shot from the window.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_225' name='page_225'></a>225</span>
Two more of their number dropped, and the rest
pulled up as suddenly as they had begun their charge.
Bartlett and the driver fired, wounding a man and
killing a horse.</p>
<p>Such a reception was more than the Apaches had
bargained for or could stand; they fired one wild, almost
aimless volley which flew well clear of the waggon,
then, urging their horses forward, they spurred past
Bartlett&rsquo;s team like a whirlwind and disappeared.</p>
<p>The inn was one kept by a Mexican and his Yankee
wife; and they, too, told fearful tales of the Apaches&rsquo;
depredations; and were both convinced that, but for
the happy arrival of the waggon, they would have been
killed, and their house plundered and burnt.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>
<h3>A JOURNEY TO THE GRAN CHACO</h3>
</div>
<p>The Gran Chaco, or &ldquo;great hunting-ground&rdquo; of
Western Paraguay, is a land of wooded plains
and little patches of primeval forest, about
which astonishingly little is known even to-day.
White men have never yet explored more than the
fringe of it, and it was to an Englishman that the
honour fell of being the first European in a period of
forty years to venture into the unknown region, as
well as of proceeding farther through it than any of his
predecessors had done. This was in 1853, when Mansfield
made his celebrated journey up the Paraguay
River.</p>
<p>Charles Blachford Mansfield, the dearly loved friend
of Kingsley, Maurice, Carlyle, and other great thinkers
of a bygone generation, was one of those men whose
physical bravery and spirit of enterprise are hidden
from all but close observers by the shyness natural to
a scholar, and by the gentle earnestness of a man who
takes life very seriously. While travelling down the
South American coast from Pernambuco to Buenos
Ayres, he incidentally heard much talk of this mysterious
hunting-ground from his fellow-passengers;
but he no sooner hinted at his desire to see it than he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_227' name='page_227'></a>227</span>
brought a hail of ridicule on himself. Who but an
Englishman would think of trying to go where the
Paraguayans themselves dared not venture?</p>
<p>The same doubts or ridicule assailed him when he
spoke of his intention to the Spanish skipper of the
river steamer on which he took a passage from Buenos
Ayres to Corrientes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ask the crew, Señor; some of them are of Indian
blood; they will tell you all about the Paraguay,&rdquo;
said he scornfully.</p>
<p>To the quiet scientist, whose pursuits kept him
mainly among people of his own social standing, this
crew was something of a revelation: Zambos, blacks,
Mestizos, Italians, Spaniards, most of them as dirty
and lazy and insubordinate as they were high. The
negroes and whites had never been farther up than
Corrientes, but some of the half-bloods had been as far
as Asuncion, and these said unhesitatingly that even
if the Englishman could get canoemen to take him up
the Paraguay to the capital, every inch of the way was
dangerous on account of the uncivilised Guaranis;
and that&mdash;supposing he reached Asuncion alive&mdash;he
would not be permitted to enter upon the Chaco.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take me as far as Corrientes and I will be responsible
for the rest,&rdquo; said Mansfield. &ldquo;At least I
can but try.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The voyage up the Parana was monotonous, for the
boat was seldom close enough to either bank to admit
of more than a confused view of the country, and the
solitary Englishman was relieved when the two days&rsquo;
journey came to an end. On the second morning, when
he went on deck the boat was making a stop, and he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_228' name='page_228'></a>228</span>
profited by it to slip off shirt and trousers and take a
cool, delicious header into the river. Coming to the
surface again he glanced up at the steamer, for the
crew were all screaming one against the other; a
charitable Zambo was heaving him a life-belt which
(on finding that there were no objectionable reptiles
anywhere near him) he laughingly refused. He had
his swim, swarmed up a rope, and reached the deck
again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did I not say he was possessed, or mad?&rdquo; he
overheard the skipper growl in Spanish.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What made the Señor do that?&rdquo; asked the
friendly Zambo soothingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For pleasure, <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">amigo</i>; and in order to be clean.
In my country it is the custom to have a cold bath or
a swim every morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The half-breed turned away, tapping his forehead
gravely, and communicated this piece of news to the
white men, who seemed even more astounded. Wash?
What <em>for</em>, in the name of all the fiends? They had
scarcely ever heard of such an operation.</p>
<p>In Corrientes, Mansfield whiled away a few days in
trying to obtain further information about the Chaco;
but without much success. The civic authorities, from
whom he had first to gain permission to move any
higher up the river, made little demur; privately they
thought the town would be well rid of a wandering
maniac. They told him that he might possibly find
Indian canoemen who would take him to Asuncion,
though he would be almost the first Englishman who
had ever been there; but that he must assume entire
responsibility for such a venture; they would offer no
hindrance, but no help either.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_229' name='page_229'></a>229</span></div>
<p>As luck would have it, while he was loitering on the
jetty one evening, a large canoe, manned by four
Indians and laden with oranges and plantains, ran
alongside. That they did not belong to these parts
was evidenced by their great size, their strange dress
and easy motions, and by the number of native words
with which their Spanish was interlarded. A crowd
of buyers gathered round them, and their cargo was
very soon disposed of; indeed, the townsfolk seemed
only too anxious to let them do their business and
take themselves off again, the brawny forest-giants
being about as welcome here as Genseric&rsquo;s Vandals
were in Rome.</p>
<p>When the crowd had dispersed, Mansfield approached
the Indians and asked if they were going
up the river again. They stared at him, more in
wonder than in ill-humour.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said one of them at last. &ldquo;To-morrow.&rdquo;
(No one in South America ever yet did anything &ldquo;to-day&rdquo;;
has not <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">mañana</i> fever become a byword?)</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to come with you. I will pay you well, if
you will take me and my luggage up to Asuncion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The savages hesitated, muttered among themselves,
and at length one remarked half-sulkily that it was a
long journey; nearly two hundred miles. The Señor
was doubtless in a hurry, and speaking for themselves
they objected to being hurried. They would want to
kill deer to take back with them; perhaps to catch fish
as well. Mansfield said that that would be no objection,
and, in the end, they agreed to set off with him
in the morning.</p>
<p>Their respect for the stranger increased somewhat
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_230' name='page_230'></a>230</span>
when, the next day, his luggage appeared, and was
found to contain a very excellent double-barrelled
gun; they themselves had only spears and bows, and
were inclined to pooh-pooh firearms except for fighting.
Who ever saw a gun kill a manatee, they asked;
or a cayman, or even an inia (fresh-water dolphin)?
The boat pushed off and swung rapidly round the bend
of the river, and out of sight of civilisation. Then the
Englishman began to cultivate his crew&rsquo;s acquaintance.
Physically they formed a striking contrast to any of the
town Indians he had seen; all were naked but for a
waist-cloth of deer-skin; their hair, done in either one
or two plaits, reached almost to their heels, though not
one of them was under six feet three. At first they
were very reserved with their employer, but when,
treating them like children, he began to distribute
sweet cakes and other confectioners&rsquo; ware, such as
they had never beheld, their tongues were loosed, one
topic led to another, and they soon forgot to be shy or
suspicious.</p>
<p>On the first day they showed no disposition to stop
or land till night-time, and as they hugged the left
bank all the way, Mansfield had the advantage of seeing
what was to be seen without the delays that he
had anticipated. Whatever else happened on this
hazardous journey, starvation would surely be kept
at a distance, for in that vast forest through which the
Paraguay runs, are no less than four hundred and fifty
varieties of birds, from eagles to creatures the size of
a thumb-nail, together with deer innumerable; while
the fish in the stream almost plead to be caught.
Mansfield already knew enough of the climate to be
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_231' name='page_231'></a>231</span>
aware that, even in summer, when the sun has gone in,
warm coverings are necessary; and he had supplied
himself with a pair of good blankets, thinking that he
would be expected to sleep in the canoe. But, at sundown,
the Indians ran inside a tiny creek and three of
them took up their bows and arrows, while the fourth
clambered up the bank, spear in hand. Mansfield
started to ask questions, but was immediately frowned
into silence.</p>
<p>The Indian disappeared behind a thick curtain of
bush and creeper, and was followed by one of his
friends, who stood on the bank within sight; while
the other two remained in the boat, standing like
beautiful copper statues, their bows bent, their eyes
fixed on the trees or the bank. After a little rustling
behind this natural curtain, there came the sharp
click of a flint and, a little later, the crackling of burning
grass; but not till a great burst of smoke arose,
followed by a roaring flare, did the other Indians drop
their weapons.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That will keep the jaguars away,&rdquo; said one of
them. &ldquo;They come down to drink just about this
time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Were you afraid that one of them might spring
out on your comrade?&rdquo; asked Mansfield.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who knows? It is not only they that have to be
guarded against. Do you hear that noise? That is
a puma; ocelots sometimes will spring upon us from
a tree; a tapir will attack us if her young one is with
her. And what of the snakes and the alligators?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then why land at all for sleeping?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Indians shivered. &ldquo;Have you never heard of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_232' name='page_232'></a>232</span>
water-boas? The Paraguay is full of them; by day
they rarely come up; but at night! Come; our fire is
big now; we are going to moor the boat and land.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When he got ashore, the traveller found that a whole
bush formed the substance of the fire; a little dry
grass had been laid to the windward side of it, and
the bush, being of a resinous nature, soon flared up like
an oil-barrel. The fire-maker was returning from
collecting fuel, and had both arms full of fallen wood,
with which he banked up a solid fire before the bush
could roar itself out. The Englishman had his own
opinion on the wisdom of lighting fires in such overgrown
spots, and was not surprised when, during that
river journey, they passed many patches&mdash;some over
a hundred acres in extent&mdash;where almost every tree
had been consumed by some recent conflagration.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So there are water-serpents here, are there?&rdquo; he
asked as they seated themselves as near to the fire as
was consistent with comfort.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; some of them thirty feet long, or even forty.
They will sometimes upset a whole canoe, or will lift
a man out of his seat and drag him to the bottom.&rdquo;
This may or may not be an Indian exaggeration, but
it is certainly a fact that the anaconda and his many
brethren in the Paraguay make no trouble of carrying
off a calf or small deer that has come down to drink.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To-morrow we must kill something,&rdquo; said another
Indian as he unwrapped a slab of <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">carne seca</i>, or dried
beef, from a strip of grass matting. &ldquo;This is all that
is left. See after the water, one of you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A redskin had brought a great pot full of water from
the river, and this he wedged nicely on the fire where
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_233' name='page_233'></a>233</span>
the ashes were the most solid. Mansfield sighed; were
they going to make chocolate, a drink which he
loathed? By the time the beef was eaten, together
with the French bread which the explorer had brought
as a special luxury for his guides, the water boiled;
and it transpired that they were not going to drink
chocolate, for one of the men produced from a bag a
great handful of dry, curled leaves, whipped the pot
off the fire and dropped the leaves into it, stirring the
whole vigorously with a stick.</p>
<p>The leaves were the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">yerba maté</i>&mdash;generally abbreviated
to <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">maté</i>&mdash;or Paraguay ilex; a sort of holly which
occupies exactly the same position among the South
Americans as tea does with the Chinese. Another
Indian cut five hollow stalks of a plant that looked to
the scientist suspiciously like hemlock; but he supposed
the man knew what he was doing, and accepted
the one that was offered to him. As soon as the decoction
was sufficiently stirred, the redskins thrust
their stalks into the almost boiling liquid and began
to suck greedily at it. Mansfield took his place in the
circle round the pot when its contents had cooled
somewhat, and found it exceedingly refreshing, though
rank and bitter to anyone not used to it. But as he
drank more freely, he became aware that, like many
other good things, it may become a curse instead of a
blessing to a man; for he soon found himself growing
drowsy under its influence; but the Indians, more
accustomed to it, were equal to his share as well as
their own, and emptied the pot unmovedly. On later
occasions he saw natives quite stupid or unconscious
through over-indulgence in the beverage.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_234' name='page_234'></a>234</span></div>
<p>He rolled himself in his blankets and was soon
asleep; but he was awakened at daybreak by the
ceaseless chatter of the monkeys in the trees overhead.
The Indians were already astir, packing up their
weapons and cooking-utensils, and showing generally
that this was the most energetic period of the day with
them. The most noticeable feature of their behaviour
now was that they had become as careless and bold as,
over night, they had been vigilant and calculating;
and this point perhaps marks more strongly than any
other the difference between the Indians north and south
of the Mexican frontier. The attacks in the dark,
the night marches so common among the northern redskins,
are almost unknown in the south and centre;
and in all likelihood this has arisen from the comparative
scarcity of nocturnal animals in the north.
For one square mile of the Amazon contains more
animals of the cat tribe than a hundred miles of the
Mississippi, and the only beasts likely to be abroad
after dark, apart from a few pumas, are the wolves, of
which the North American Indian has no fear.</p>
<p>Mansfield and two of the guides had got into the
canoe, when those on the bank held up each a warning
hand and fitted an arrow to his bow. A rustling
noise came from among the trees and a very graceful
though short-legged deer came bounding from between
them. No deer ever moved at such a speed unless
frightened or pursued, and the Englishman was not
surprised to see a dark-skinned animal rise from the
ground some few feet behind the fugitive and fall full
on its back with a snarling roar that a good-sized lion
could scarcely have beaten. A confident smile played
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_235' name='page_235'></a>235</span>
over the faces of the Indians in the boat, who took no
more notice of the slayer than they would have done
of a rabbit.</p>
<div class='figcenter'>

<p class='caption'>
<span class='smcap'>Stocking the Larder</span><br />
<br />
As they watched from the canoe a graceful deer darted out of the thicket closely pursued by a full-grown jaguar. No sooner had he slain his prey than the two Indians coolly approached and planted one arrow in his neck and another in his ribs, and while one of them dragged away the carcase of the deer, the other put an end to the jaguar with his spear.<br />
</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why should not the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">tigre</i> save us the trouble of
hunting?&rdquo; said one, disdaining all pretence at silence.</p>
<p>Just then the roar was repeated, this time more ear-splitting
than before; the yell of a beast in great pain.
Mansfield peered through the bushes and saw the
Guaranis walking in very leisurely manner towards the
place where the deer had fallen. Almost as its assailant&mdash;a
full-grown male jaguar&mdash;put an end to its
struggles by taking the head between its immense paws
and breaking the neck, two arrows had pierced him
simultaneously; one through the ribs and the other
through the neck, and the howl which the watchers in
the boat had heard was his last.</p>
<p>The taller of the Indians dragged the deer&rsquo;s carcase
free, while his companion contemptuously drove his
spear-blade into the expiring jaguar, and the venison
was quickly butchered and brought in triumph to the
canoe. The two hunters chuckled as they got into the
boat; they had now enough food for to-day&rsquo;s needs
and meant to take it easy: another difference between
the Indian who lives within the tropics and him who
lives outside; only hunger or strict business will
prompt the one to exert himself to go a-hunting; the
other is a sportsman born.</p>
<p>No event worth chronicling befell the little crew till,
a day or two later, they were within ten miles of
Asuncion. The canoemen were dipping their paddles
lazily, and Mansfield himself was inclined to doze, for
it was getting towards the middle of the day, when a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_236' name='page_236'></a>236</span>
horrified whisper, which he could not catch, passed
from mouth to mouth. In an instant the Guaranis
threw off their lethargy, and the explorer saw that a
look of terror had come into every eye; the paddles
flew through the water, the men straining till the
sweat streamed down their faces, and till their veins
swelled as though they must burst.</p>
<p>He spoke encouragingly to them, but obtained no
answer; the Indians only paddled the faster, till their
panic began to communicate itself to him; for it is
always the unknown that is most terrifying. Two
minutes passed, and they did not abate their speed or
answer the questions put to them. Surely it could not
be anything so very awful, for, only ten minutes before,
a schooner-rigged vessel had overtaken them on its
way up the river; whatever the peril was, she seemed
to have escaped it. Mansfield had known what danger
was, for he had worked like a hero among the poor of
South London during the cholera outbreak of five
years before; but, when the third minute had passed,
he found that the suspense was becoming unbearable.
A minute is a short time, but those who have passed
through great danger or uncertainty know that it can
sometimes seem like a week.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well; now what was it?&rdquo; he asked, breaking into
a laugh as the men, uttering exclamations of relief,
rested on their paddles and wiped their brows.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hornets!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>Hornets?</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You laugh, Señor. God help us if they had
followed us. Did you not hear their murmurings?
Some fiend-begotten monkey had disturbed their nest;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_237' name='page_237'></a>237</span>
&rsquo;tis to be hoped he has got his reward. Two of my
brothers were stung to death last year in less than a
minute by a swarm of them; and there is a man of
our tribe who is stone-blind through them.&rdquo;</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>Asuncion is, to-day, a town of only forty-five
thousand inhabitants, and had not then half that
number. With the exception of W. P. Robertson and
a few other bold traders, Charles Mansfield was probably
the only Englishman who had then set foot inside
it. He made it his head-quarters for the next two and
a half months, and, during that time, made various
excursions into the Gran Chaco.</p>
<p>On one occasion he joined a party of Indians who
were going out there deer-hunting; and, though there
was nothing specially new to him in their methods, he
was enabled to examine the country under favourable
circumstances. No doubt there was something in the
report of its inhabitants being dangerous; for the men
with him were hardy, fearless fellows, well used to
bearing arms; and even these would not attempt to
reach the more distant of the inhabited regions.</p>
<p>To him the hunting was more wearisome than agreeable,
for it consisted mainly in crawling along on
hands and knees mile after mile&mdash;so it seemed&mdash;till the
sportsmen were within bowshot of a herd, which
promptly fled before a single arrow could be launched
at them. The crawling began again, and in course of
time another or the same herd was reached, and
these fled at the first discharge of arrows. The carcases
were collected and hidden, and the creeping was
begun afresh, but no more herds were overtaken. Then
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_238' name='page_238'></a>238</span>
the Indians had recourse to a very common though unsportsmanlike
dodge; they concealed themselves,
shortly before sundown, by a river where, as the wind
was, the deer would not scent them when they came
down their usual path to the water. But, further
disappointment, a thunderstorm came on, the deer
spent the night under the trees, and the Indians went
home disgusted.</p>
<p>With the practical eye of a real philanthropist,
Mr. Mansfield noted all the advantages of this great
and fertile hunting-ground&mdash;or as much of it as he
was able to see. He returned to England full of a great
project for colonising the Chaco and educating the
Indians&mdash;a scheme which was never carried out. For,
only a few months later, while he was performing a
chemical experiment, a naphtha-still ignited; and,
while pluckily trying to throw it into the street to save
the house from catching fire, he sustained injuries
which caused his death, at the early age of thirty-six.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX</h2>
<h3>AMONG THE SERIS OF MEXICO</h3>
</div>
<p>It is a fact generally acknowledged throughout
the American continent, that the Indian population
have never yet failed to take advantage of
war, revolution, or other political crises among the
white settlers, to make themselves more than usually
troublesome. From 1810 to 1867, Mexico went through
a troublous period of rebellion and warfare; which is
another way of saying that, for fifty-seven years, the
Mexican Indians saw themselves at liberty to plunder
and slay without the least fear of organised opposition;
and judging from the account given by the German-Polish
traveller, Gustav von Tempsky, they seem to
have made use of their opportunity.</p>
<p>After three years&rsquo; residence in California, Herr von
Tempsky, with an American friend, Dr. Steel, took
ship from San Francisco to Mazatlan, intending to
explore the southern spurs of the Sierra Madre, and to
return to the States overland. This was in 1853-4, a
time when the Government, such as it was, had perhaps
reached the summit of its helplessness; which
will explain why, on arriving at Mazatlan, the travellers
found plenty of counsellors ready to confirm the advice
they had heard in California: &ldquo;Keep out of Mexico,
if you value your lives.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_240' name='page_240'></a>240</span></div>
<p>Not to be deterred by mere hearsay, the two friends
hired mules and guides, and at once set out eastwards,
far more anxious to escape to the highlands from the
tropical heat of Mazatlan, than apprehensive of interference
from Indians. Yet, as the country grew
lonelier and more rugged, the mules less tractable and
the guides less self-confident, the journey certainly began
to lose some of the romantic charm which, from a safe
distance, it had promised to possess; and when,
towards nightfall of the third day&rsquo;s march, a tropical
thunderstorm suddenly burst upon them, and the
Mexican guides announced that the nearest shelter
was at a hill village ten miles distant, both the adventurers
found themselves thinking wistfully of the cosy
steamer which they had recently left. Those ten miles
seemed like a hundred; the rain continued to fall like
a cataract; a baggage-mule took to flight and had to
be pursued; then the animal ridden by the doctor got
his forefeet in a hole, and for some time refused to
move; and, by way of a little further diversion, the
guides began to quarrel among themselves as to the
precise direction in which the village lay.</p>
<p>The end of the journey came at last, however, but
not the end of their annoyances. As the drenched
men came within a stone&rsquo;s-throw of half a dozen feeble
lights for which they had been making, they heard
an excited buzz of voices, and, without warning, a
dozen or more guns were fired in their direction. A
baggage-mule dropped screaming from a skin wound
on the shoulder, and one bullet passed so close to the
doctor&rsquo;s head that the broad brim of his <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">sombrero</i> was
perforated.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_241' name='page_241'></a>241</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Back, everybody,&rdquo; shouted one of the guides.
&ldquo;It is an Indian ambuscade. They are firing from
shelter, and we can do nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But von Tempsky had caught the sound of something
which gave him a little comfort; to wit, an
expression in French from one of the shooters.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; he shouted in French.</p>
<p>The reply was in the same language. &ldquo;Halt there;
stay where you are and let us know your business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think we want to stop here to get soaked
a little more?&rdquo; shouted Dr. Steel, urging on his mule
before his friend had had time to frame an explanation.
&ldquo;Come along; we guessed they were Indians, and they
paid us the same compliment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The volley was not repeated; but a crowd of men
with rifles and lanterns came scurrying to meet the
little cavalcade; and, after some laughter and expressions
of regret, their leader began a voluble explanation,
which von Tempsky cut very short by
announcing that he and his party were wet to the skin
and required shelter. Thereupon they were ushered
into the building whence the shots had been fired,
which proved to be a tumble-down inn kept by an old
Frenchman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have been much beset by the Seris of late,&rdquo; he
said apologetically. &ldquo;Three times during the past
fortnight have we had the village surrounded by
parties of them; and, when we heard you approach
so late at night, we naturally supposed you to be
Indians.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The tavern offered little enough comfort; but provisions
were plentiful, and there was a good fire where
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_242' name='page_242'></a>242</span>
clothes could be dried. The tales which the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">rancheros</i>
had to tell were certainly appalling. Several villages
had been entirely depopulated by the savages; many
inoffensive travellers had been killed, and others had
escaped with the bare life. These Seri Indians were&mdash;and
even now are&mdash;a fierce, intractable people, utterly
different from the typical Mexican Indians, who (the
Comanches and Apaches apart) are a mild, diligent,
and strongly religious race. Mexico still possesses some
fifty tribes of redskins, most of which are subdivisions
of the very ancient Nahuatl family; but, with the exception
of the three tribes just mentioned, many of
these had, before von Tempsky&rsquo;s time, begun to intermarry
with Europeans and settle in the towns.</p>
<p>At first all the guides except Jago, the leader, flatly
refused to go any farther, on hearing these gruesome
stories; but when, on the next day, a dozen of the
<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">rancheros</i> offered to accompany the party as far as
Durango, on condition that they would combine with
them against any Indians they might meet, the
grumbling ceased; for no one was averse to getting
a shot at the men who, at one time or other, had
robbed every one of them of friend or property. Von
Tempsky and Steel were nothing loth, either; the one
came from a country where persecution and death
were everyday matters; while the other had roughed
it for five-and-twenty years, first in the backwoods
and latterly at the Californian diggings, where it was
a case of &ldquo;a word and a blow&mdash;and the blow first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a day or two no sign of Indians was observed,
and despite the irregularity of the road and the alarming
prevalence of <a name='TC_3'></a><ins class="trchange" title="Was 'rattle-snakes'">rattlesnakes</ins>, the journey was not
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_243' name='page_243'></a>243</span>
unpleasant. But on the third afternoon, as the guide
Jago was seeking to point out from a distance the
village where the company was to pass the night, he
uttered a horrified exclamation, and made the sign of
the cross. At the same moment an angry hubbub
arose from the group of <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">rancheros</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it? What are they all looking at?&rdquo;
inquired von Tempsky.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Smoke; and plenty of it,&rdquo; said the doctor, who
was shading his eyes with his hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay; smoke,&rdquo; said Jago, who spoke English quite
well. &ldquo;They have burnt another village. Let us go
forward quickly, Señors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>An hour&rsquo;s sharp riding brought them to what, a day
earlier, had been a fertile settlement or <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">rancho</i>, but
which was now nothing but a pile of smouldering wood-ashes,
round about which lay fully fifty corpses of men,
women, and children. At the sight, both guides and
<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">rancheros</i> went almost mad with indignation; and
von Tempsky himself was eager to press on immediately
in pursuit of the wretches who had been guilty of
such relentless slaughter. It was then that the more
phlegmatic Yankee doctor showed the rest the value
of a cool and calculating head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See here, boys,&rdquo; he said in his best Spanish, when
he could make his voice heard above the howls and
oaths of vengeance; &ldquo;I reckon a redskin&rsquo;s a redskin,
whether he hails from here or &rsquo;way north. <em>I&rsquo;d</em> got no
quarrel with these particular vermin, till I saw <em>this</em>.
Now I fought Indians before some of you were born;
and I&rsquo;ll do it again if you&rsquo;ll let me. But there&rsquo;ll have
to be none of this tear-away sort of game that some of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_244' name='page_244'></a>244</span>
you are after. Will you make me captain? You can
soon turn me out of it again if you&rsquo;re not satisfied.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">rancheros</i> wavered for a moment. Why obey a
perfect stranger, who knew neither the country nor the
Seris? But the look of simple honesty, yet of bull-dog
determination and pluck, in the man&rsquo;s face, gave
confidence even to the most hesitating.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very good, Señor Doctor; we will obey you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They mean they&rsquo;ll <em>try</em>, poor fellows,&rdquo; said Steel, in
English, to von Tempsky. &ldquo;They don&rsquo;t know what
discipline is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By his orders, mules and horses were ungirthed, and
while he, Jago, and the oldest of the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">rancheros</i> made a
careful examination of the first mile of the track left
by the murderers, the others lay down to rest and eat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They have crossed the ridge,&rdquo; said Steel when he
rejoined his fellow-traveller. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll all of us take four
hours&rsquo; rest now. It&rsquo;ll be no real delay. Those rascals
are fifty miles away by this time, as like as not; perhaps
a hundred, for these poor souls have been dead
a good many hours. We needn&rsquo;t worry; we shall
come up with them later; or with more like them,
who&rsquo;ll have to pay for this picnic.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The doctor was probably not exaggerating the
distance covered by the Seris. The youngsters of the
tribe were put on a horse as soon as they could straddle
him; their only toys were bows and arrows, and the
generally Spartan upbringing which all underwent
enabled them to ride or march or fight for a whole day
without food or rest. Large bodies of Seris or Comanches
would move a hundred and thirty miles in a
day.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_245' name='page_245'></a>245</span></div>
<p>Stifling their impatience as well as they could, the
avenging party waited till the four hours had expired;
then all set off on their mountain climb, though darkness
would be coming on almost immediately. Half
a mile from the top of the ridge, von Tempsky was
seen to spring from his saddle and make a dash at
some dark object that lay in the shelter of a rock.
Before he had reached it, however, a scuffling, clattering
sound arose near him, and a horse, saddled but
riderless, struggled to his feet. The others halted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Show a light some of you; I&rsquo;ve got him,&rdquo; shouted
von Tempsky. &ldquo;But&mdash;why, the man&rsquo;s dead!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jago dismounted, and, striking a light, revealed the
pallid face of a Mexican, who lay with an arrow through
his back. Von Tempsky, who had been the only one of
the riders to notice the recumbent figure, had imagined
it to be that of an Indian spy or sentinel, and had at
once made a grab at his throat, only to find the body
stiff and quite cold.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One more score against them,&rdquo; cried the doctor.
&ldquo;Ride on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They travelled all night and till long after daybreak,
without meeting or seeing anyone; and at length Steel
called another halt for a few hours. Presently, as he
and von Tempsky sat chatting, the latter drew his
attention to a body of mounted men riding slowly
across their projected path, a couple of miles away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got them this time,&rdquo; said Steel, jumping up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those are not Indians, Señor,&rdquo; said Jago.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tch! Look at their spears, man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do. They are our Mexican lancers. There; do
you not hear their bugle?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_246' name='page_246'></a>246</span></div>
<p>A faint note or two from some brass instrument was
carried to them by the wind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right; mount,&rdquo; cried the doctor. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll
have a look at them, anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They had not gone more than a few hundred yards,
when the new-comers caught sight of them riding down
the incline; they reined up and, waving their lances,
greeted them with jubilant shouts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well&mdash;of all the scraggy-looking donkey-drivers!&rdquo;
exclaimed Steel in an aside, as they came up with the
&ldquo;lancers.&rdquo; There were about eighty of them, all more
or less in rags, each man armed with a lance, a very
rusty sabre, and a carbine. In their midst, two men
held their lances aloft, each spear-point being decorated
with the head of an Indian. The men were hearty-looking,
happy-go-lucky ruffians, brave as need be,
but woefully undisciplined, and out of gear generally.
After one glance at them, von Tempsky no longer
wondered that many an Englishman, Irishman, Scot,
or Yankee who would think himself lucky if he ever
rose to the rank of sergeant, at home, could here
become a field-marshal or an admiral in half an hour.
For the Mexico of those days was, like the southern
republics, a happy hunting-ground for foreign soldiers
of fortune.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And they send <em>these</em> fellows to put down an Indian
rising!&rdquo; he muttered to the doctor; adding aloud,
in Spanish: &ldquo;Is that all you have killed? Who is
your officer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The lancers grinned. No; they had killed at least
thirty, out of some two hundred. Officer? H&rsquo;m!
Nobody was quite sure. The two men with the heads
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_247' name='page_247'></a>247</span>
were <em>supposed</em> to be something in that line; but
really they couldn&rsquo;t say for certain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right; pray go on. I and my troop will follow
you,&rdquo; said Steel.</p>
<p>There was one advantage in having fallen in with
these ragamuffins; two at least of their number were
half-bloods, with eyes like hawks for a trail; and this
put an end to all doubt as to the way which must be
followed now that the plain was reached. Some of the
lancers had more terrible tales of the Indians to add to
what the travellers already knew. A priest and a
farmer had been murdered two days before; and, only
that morning, three ladies had been found speared to
death near an <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">estancia</i> (farm).</p>
<p>The track wound in serpentine fashion, now skirting
a town, now going straight through a <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">rancho</i> whence
the occupants had fled. By late afternoon the pursuers
were within half a dozen miles of Durango; but
here the track&mdash;more visible than ever now, in the long
grass to which they had come&mdash;broke away at an
obtuse angle, towards the more hilly ground on their
right. The doctor pulled up, and he and von Tempsky
began to confer with the soldiers. Horses and mules
and men were all jaded, urged Steel; and the trail
might lead them on through another all-night journey;
and to no purpose. Why not ride for the town, take
a short rest, and beat up recruits?</p>
<p>The question was being argued and re-argued, when
a series of whistles, followed by one concerted and unearthly
yell, proceeded from the hills; and, like a pack
of wolves, the Indians for whom they had been hunting
came charging down the slope; full three hundred of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_248' name='page_248'></a>248</span>
them, stark naked, their bodies painted scarlet and
black, their hair and their horses decked with feathers.
Steel looked glumly at his own little army. Oh for a
couple of dozen well-armed men who had learned the
virtues of obedience and combination!</p>
<p>&ldquo;You lancers prepare to receive their charge,&rdquo; he
shouted; and motioned to his own men to draw off
and be ready to attack the Seris in the rear. He was
obeyed indifferently; further urged by von Tempsky
and Jago, the guides and <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">rancheros</i> were wheeling
slowly northwards; but the lancers were evidently
more than half minded to charge wholesale at the
oncoming savages.</p>
<p>It is proverbial that the greater the pain or the
danger or the suspense, the more readily a man finds
time to notice minute detail that has little or nothing
to do with the matter in hand. Steel observed, on this
occasion&mdash;though the yelling mob was within thirty
yards of him&mdash;that apparently not a man of them was
under six feet in height; that every man sat his horse
as though he were a part of it, and that each carried a
spear, bow, and quiver, and also a trumpery-looking
round shield, studded with bits of brass, shell, and
looking-glass. As he had half anticipated, the savages
suddenly changed their tactics on reaching the hill
foot, and wheeled sharply towards the smaller force.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lancers, charge, the moment our volley&rsquo;s fired,&rdquo;
shouted the doctor. &ldquo;Fire!&mdash;Charge! <em>Charge</em>, you
thick-headed clod-hoppers, can&rsquo;t you?&mdash;O Lord!&rdquo;
His voice died away in a disheartened little groan.</p>
<p>For the lancers might so easily have had it all their
own way; at least twenty redskins had fallen before
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_249' name='page_249'></a>249</span>
the carbines of the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">rancheros</i>, and clearly the rest were
surprised and confused. Yet there sat these intelligent
lancers, their spears in rest, calmly unslinging their
carbines for a volley that was quite as likely to hurt
their own side as the enemy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t be helped now,&rdquo; said the doctor to his
followers. &ldquo;Blaze away at them as best you can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There were no quick-firing magazine-rifles in those
days, and with the exception of von Tempsky and
Steel, who had each a couple of revolvers, every man
was armed with a muzzle-loader; but necessity had
long been the mother of invention with the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">rancheros</i>,
as with the trappers and the Gauchos. Wads were
dispensed with; a generous pinch of powder was
thrown into the barrel, and each man had his mouth
full of bullets, ready to spit one after the powder; a
cap was hastily stuck on the pin and everyone was
ready for another volley. But even as it was fired, a
shower of arrows was launched at each troop, and
many a man dropped forward in his saddle. Already
the boot was on the other leg; it was the whites who
were confused now, while the Indians had recovered
their coolness; and, with a discord of howls, they
swiftly separated into two parts, one preparing to
charge at each white division.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pull yourselves together!&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Die like men!&rdquo;
cried Steel and von Tempsky respectively, as, abandoning
their bridles and with a revolver in each hand, they
rode straight to meet the charge; while one half of
the lancers fled, and the other half sought to cut a way
through their assailants and rejoin the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">rancheros</i>.</p>
<p>The doctor fired off six shots into the front rank as
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_250' name='page_250'></a>250</span>
the two forces met, and four Indians fell dead; but
his own mule dropped under him, transfixed by a
spear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here you are; mount,&rdquo; bawled von Tempsky in
his ear, just when, in imagination, he was already
being trampled down by the Indians&rsquo; horses.</p>
<p>The ready-witted Pole had sent a bullet into the
head of the redskin nearest him, and as he fell, had
caught the bridle of his horse. The old backwoodsman,
active as a cat, sprang to the horse&rsquo;s back, and the
next moment was emptying his second revolver into
the faces of the enemy. Meanwhile, the lancers fought
furiously but spasmodically. Their lances could not
avail them against the war-hatchets of the savages;
and while one half clubbed their carbines, the other
made but fruitless play with their sabres, seeking at
the same time to drown the howls of the Indians with
their own.</p>
<p>But suddenly, when the fight was at its hottest, and
when the issue was very much in the balance, a cry of
dismay broke from one batch of redskins, who, pointing
towards Durango, began to wheel round with the
obvious intention of taking flight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Help is coming,&rdquo; cried Jago encouragingly; and,
looking back for an instant, Steel saw about forty men,
splendidly mounted, and coming up at a gallop from
the direction of the town. The second division of the
enemy followed the example of the first, and turned
to flee. The forty strangers, without uttering a word
as they swept past, dashed in pursuit, firing while still
at the gallop. It was vain for the Indians to goad their
tired horses; those of the rescuing party were fresh.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_251' name='page_251'></a>251</span>
Before they had gone a mile they were overtaken, and
Steel, who had followed as best he could, heard a voice
cry in English:</p>
<p>&ldquo;No quarter; they don&rsquo;t deserve mercy. If we take
prisoners, the Mexicans will torture them to death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a few minutes there was not an Indian left alive;
every man of the fugitives had fallen before the ceaseless
shower of bullets poured into their ranks by the
strangers.</p>
<p>The very sort of men for whom Steel had been longing
had come; forty of the Texan mounted militia, who had
been sent down-country to treat for mules, had put
themselves at the disposal of the Durango police for the
suppression of the Indian hordes; and on this, as on
subsequent occasions, the punishment which they
served out was so terrible that the redskins fled south
and east, or hid in the hills, and for a year or two, at
least, little was heard of their attacking either travellers
or homesteads.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XX</h2>
<h3>A HOLIDAY AMONG THE OJIBEWAS</h3>
</div>
<p>We have already spoken, in Chapter VIII, of the
Algonquin branch of the red race. This vast
family, comprising Ojibewas, Shawnees, Crees,
Araphoes, Blackfeet, etc., once owned practically the
whole of South Canada, as well as the eastern portion
of the States as far down as Kentucky. The territory
peculiar to the Ojibewas ran in a rough curve from
Saratoga to Winnipeg, and round about the lake
district; but as the construction of the railway from
New York to Montreal seemed to establish the definite
claim of the white men, the Indians retreated farther
north, some taking service under the farmers, or
settling down to farm for themselves; others wandering
in what was left of the prairie and forest land, and
turning an occasional dishonest penny by robbing
unprotected travellers.</p>
<p>When Charles Richard Weld made his tour from
Boston into and through Southern Canada in 1854,
only a part of the railway was made, and the greater
portion of the journey had to be accomplished by
coach, by canoe, or on horseback. Mr. Weld (who
must not be confused with Isaac Weld, the explorer,
his half-brother) was a barrister and literary man, in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_253' name='page_253'></a>253</span>
whom a close personal friendship with many great
travellers, including Sir John Barrow and Sir John
Franklin, had bred a strong ambition to see the world
and make discoveries on his own account. But a busy
man, who adds to his other duties the secretaryship
of the Royal Society, must perforce stay at home,
and it was not till 1850, when he was a man of thirty-seven,
that he saw his way to travelling; and that
only by devoting the long vacation of each year to
visiting some special quarter of the globe.</p>
<p>It was while journeying northwards on this railway
that he encountered his first real &ldquo;sight,&rdquo; which
was a prairie-fire: a swiftly-moving mass of flame and
smoke that rolled almost up to the very rails, making
the occupants of the cars feel as though they were in an
oven. The fire raged for a good many days, for long
after Weld had left the railroad and transferred
himself to the coach for Lake George, he could still see
the smoke and flare in the distance.</p>
<p>The major part of the coach-route lay along a plank
road, bounded on either side by miles of monotonous
prairie, or by dark patches of pine-wood, where
squirrels, deer, and red foxes abounded. The &ldquo;coach&rdquo;
was an open arrangement&mdash;a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">char-à-bancs</i>, in fact; and
Mr. Weld&rsquo;s travelling companions consisted of three
farmers, a couple of French trappers, a wheezy old
Irishwoman and her two granddaughters. On the last
stage of the journey, when they were within a few miles
of the lake-shore, the Englishman&rsquo;s attention was
attracted by the driver to a dark mass that was moving
rapidly through the long grass, towards the road.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Injuns; see em?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_254' name='page_254'></a>254</span></div>
<p>About a score of Ojibewas in full war-dress were
riding at the top of their speed, with the apparent
intention of cutting off the vehicle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well; I suppose they won&rsquo;t hurt <em>us</em>?&rdquo; said Weld.</p>
<p>The coachman whipped up his horses. &ldquo;I reckon
they hadn&rsquo;t better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As nobody seemed in the least alarmed, the tourist
watched the approach of the Indians rather with
interest than with anxiety. Nevertheless, as the
redskins, on coming within a hundred yards, suddenly
set up an inharmonious howling, and brandished spears
or tomahawks, he thought it time to produce and
examine his revolver. Just then the horses were pulled
up short, and the driver took from beneath his feet
a very workmanlike double-barrelled gun; and, looking
round him, Weld saw that the other men were doing
the same; while even the old woman and the two girls,
albeit without a sign of undue excitement, had each
brought out a revolver from her reticule.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the way to let &rsquo;em have it,&rdquo; said the driver,
having fired off both barrels at the advancing mob.
Before a second gun could be fired, the whole troop had
wheeled about, and were riding away as quickly as they
had come. The coachman reloaded as though nothing
unusual had happened, put away his rifle, and started
the horses again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Biggest cowards on the yearth,&rdquo; he mumbled to
Weld. &ldquo;That was only a couple o&rsquo; charges o&rsquo; birdshot
I give &rsquo;em. Bless ye, we know &rsquo;em by heart now.
Years ago they&rsquo;d put-up a mail, and tomahawk everybody;
but nowadays they seem to run away as soon
as they see a gun. If there&rsquo;d only been you an&rsquo; me,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_255' name='page_255'></a>255</span>
or nobody but women, they&rsquo;d ha&rsquo; tried to bluff <em>something</em>
out of us, if &rsquo;twas only a keg o&rsquo; spirits, or a bit
of tobacker; but half a dozen men&rsquo;ll frighten the lives
out of &rsquo;em. One time o&rsquo; day they&rsquo;d send a charge of
arrows first; but they&rsquo;re shy of that if they see any
rifles waiting for &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was Weld&rsquo;s first and only experience of an
Indian assault, for the few wild tribes with which he
came in contact were quite disorganised, had lost confidence
in their traditional weapons of war, and had
as yet a wholesome horror of gunpowder. But this
absence of hostilities enabled him to get a good insight
into Ojibewa forest and river life, and afforded him
plenty of interesting adventure where hunting was
concerned. At the lake-side inn, where he stayed for a
few days, the host invited him to attend an Ojibewa
rattlesnake-hunt, a form of sport of which he had
never before heard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What weapons must I take?&rdquo; he asked before
starting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, nothing. Put a gun (revolver) in your pocket
if you like,&rdquo; was the careless reply.</p>
<p>A small party of redskins were squatting outside the
inn, and seeing that the two white men were ready to
accompany them, they led the way to a hilly and well-wooded
spot, just on the eastern shore of the lake.
Weld noticed that the only arms carried by them
were a knife and a long, slender stick, and from all
he had heard of the terrible rattlesnake, this appeared
a poor equipment indeed wherewith to kill reptiles
which might be any length up to eight or even ten feet.
Being prepared for a very great deal of wariness and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_256' name='page_256'></a>256</span>
of elaborate preliminary on the part of the Indians,
he was, of course, <em>not</em> prepared for the entire absence
of such preliminary. One of the hunters who walked
beside him stooped unconcernedly, picked up a strip
of something, gave it a shake, and put it in his game-bag.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>He</em> always seems to find the first one,&rdquo; remarked
the innkeeper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The first <em>what</em>?&rdquo; queried Weld. &ldquo;And what on
earth is this awful stench?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rattlesnake,&rdquo; chuckled the Yankee. &ldquo;See&rsquo;d
him pick it up, didn&rsquo;t ye? Come on; here&rsquo;s a chance
for <em>you</em>, now.&mdash;Bah! What in the &rsquo;nation did ye
want to do <em>that</em> for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>For, without any hesitation, Weld had pulled out
his revolver and sent two bullets into the body of a
snake which, coiled up like a wire spring, had placed
itself across a narrow path, and was rearing its head
in an uncomfortably suggestive manner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did you expect me to do?&rdquo; asked Weld
with some impatience.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, <em>this</em>.&mdash;Stand clear!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the Yankee was too &ldquo;cocksure,&rdquo; as the boys
say; and was only too glad to spring back again to the
side of his guest. What he had <em>tried</em> to do was to seize
another snake by the tail and &ldquo;snap&rdquo; it, as a carter
cracks a whip; but the creature&rsquo;s mouth and poison-fangs
happened to be very much in the way just then,
and the innkeeper left the task to the more expert
Ojibewas.</p>
<p>Now that he knew what to expect, Weld retired to
a safe distance and began to note all that took place.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_257' name='page_257'></a>257</span>
The overpowering smell of which he had complained
arose from the snakes themselves. The rats, rabbits,
squirrels, etc., on which they feed begin to putrefy as
soon as they are swallowed, owing to the action of the
poison, and one snake is often enough to make a whole
neighbourhood intolerable.</p>
<p>The majority of those captured were small, averaging
about three and a half feet long, and the activity of the
Indians in detecting, seizing, and killing them was
almost incredible. In most cases the snake was lying,
straight or coiled as the case might be, in the tracks
usually followed by small animals in their periodical
path to the water, for rattlesnakes are singularly
slow in their movement, and so are forced to rely
more on their proverbial &ldquo;wisdom.&rdquo; The moment
one of them was discovered it was whisked off the
ground so rapidly that it seemed to fly up; one deft jerk,
or whip-like flick, dislocated its backbone and it was
dead. To an Englishman the process sounds about as
sane and as safe as lifting a bull-terrier by the tail; but
the Indians did their work unmovedly, not a man was
bitten, and Weld learned later that not once in ten
years was such hunting attended with fatal results to
anyone; for should a man be bitten a rough sort
of cautery, or the sucking of the wound, together with
drugs taken internally, generally gave the lie to the
popular belief that a rattlesnake&rsquo;s bite is incurable.</p>
<p>Where a captive was inconveniently large or long, or
where he refused to uncoil himself, the savages used
their sticks, either to rap him on the head, or to
&ldquo;straighten-out&rdquo; his coils. The object in killing was
to obtain the oil and gall, which were highly valued
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_258' name='page_258'></a>258</span>
for medicinal and other virtues; therefore, any blow
that might wound the body was avoided if possible.
In Weld&rsquo;s opinion the &ldquo;rattle&rdquo; of the animal has
been much exaggerated by travellers; &ldquo;creaking&rdquo;
or &ldquo;rustling&rdquo; would be a better term, for the noise
resembles that made by stiff paper, or parchment,
when crumpled in the hand. A few days later, when
travelling up-country by canoe, he realised that these
snakes can swim with perfect ease, for the Ojibewa
guides whom he had engaged more than once drew
his attention to one of them gliding down the bank
and into the water in determined pursuit of a rat
that had refused to become a victim to its supposed
(and very doubtful) powers of fascination.</p>
<p>For the first time in his life, Mr. Weld now found
himself completely cut off from association with white
men, for he had before him a lonely journey by river
and lake to a backwoods settlement, where an old
friend, Major Strickland, had set up a model farm.
Fortunately, one of the Ojibewas spoke English fluently,
and the other three had at least a smattering of
French. Perhaps they were not remarkable for their
intelligence, save where canoeing and hunting were
concerned, but at least they were amiable, obliging,
and contented.</p>
<p>His first acquaintance with rapids was worthy of
remark, for it came without a moment&rsquo;s warning or
preparation. He and two Indians travelled in one
canoe, while the other two followed, in a second, with
his baggage. Weld was lying back, idly smoking, and
probably lost in admiration of the solemn, rugged
beauty of the steep banks, fringed with pine and cedar
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_259' name='page_259'></a>259</span>
trees, when all in a moment the world seemed to turn
over and slip from under him; his head struck the
gunwale smartly, and he gradually got a dim notion
that he was standing with his back against something
hard and his body at right angles to that of the Indian
in the bows, who nevertheless continued to ply his
paddle stolidly, and without a smile or a word. For
a few seconds the boat trebled her speed in some
unaccountable manner, then followed another jerk,
another knock on the head, and once more he was
lounging in his former position, and the canoe moving
along as before.</p>
<p>He now threw a glance behind him, and shuddered,
for what he saw was a sheer fall of water, apparently
about sixteen feet high, studded everywhere with
ugly-looking rocks. He began an angry remonstrance
with the Indians for not having warned him, but just
then a weird cry, something between the bray of a
jackass and the wail of a peacock, echoed through the
forest. One second a large white body was seen
flapping over their heads; the next, the same body
lay fluttering on the water near the boat. One of the
Ojibewas had dropped his paddle and, like lightning,
sent an arrow through the noisy creature, which
turned out to be a pelican that they had disturbed
from its evening fishing.</p>
<p>On the following morning, as Weld was finishing his
breakfast over his camp fire, he was aroused from
his meditations by one of the Indians pointing significantly
towards the thicket behind him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Morning! Have you got a drop of tea left;
we&rsquo;re thirsty,&rdquo; cried a voice as he turned his head,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_260' name='page_260'></a>260</span>
and a second added, &ldquo;Well, Peter; what are you doing
round our neighbourhood?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Indian who spoke English jumped up delightedly,
and greeted with much respect three strapping
young fellows who suddenly stepped out from among
the bushes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know who you are, gentlemen,&rdquo; said Weld
as he rose to welcome them, &ldquo;but it&rsquo;s good to hear
one&rsquo;s own language spoken again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The lads introduced themselves as farm pupils of
Major Strickland&rsquo;s, and, leaving the Indians to bring
Weld&rsquo;s luggage by water, they showed him a short
cut to his friend&rsquo;s house, which, in a straight line,
was but seven miles away.</p>
<p>At the farm he was surprised to find Indians performing
all the domestic offices of a civilised household,
and dressed more or less in European garb; for, tired
of the ingrained laziness of negro servants, the Major
had long had all the menial work of his house and
estate done by redskins, and these, as far as Weld could
see, worked diligently and honestly. One small body
of them were kept constantly employed as hunters,
and instructors in woodcraft to the pupils, and,
judging from their abilities as deer-trackers, the lads
could have had no better tutors.</p>
<p>An animal much coveted for the sake both of its
skin and its flesh was the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cabrit</i>, prong-buck, or prong-horned
antelope, as it is variously called; and the
stalking of this creature was Weld&rsquo;s principal amusement
during his stay. In spite of frequent slaughter
among them, large herds were often to be seen in the
neighbourhood, and one day no less than a hundred
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_261' name='page_261'></a>261</span>
carcases were brought home, to be dried for winter
food.</p>
<p>The hunting party on this occasion consisted of
Weld, Strickland, and six other Englishmen, together
with about thirty Ojibewas, a dozen of whom were
given a start of five hours. These, leaving the farm
at daybreak, moved swiftly through the sparse forest
to the hills beyond, and started a herd of over two
hundred. Taking up positions at wide intervals from
each other, the Indians succeeded in frightening and
mystifying the bucks, and gradually driving them
towards the spot for which the main body of the hunt
was now making. This was some ten miles from the
farm, and so rapidly did all his companions cover the
distance, that Weld had great difficulty in keeping up
with them, though himself a strong and athletic man.</p>
<p>One old Ojibewa was always a few yards ahead of
the party, and Weld was instructed to watch and obey
every signal made by him. Sometimes he came to a
dead halt, and the whole troop followed his example,
not so much as a whisper being uttered; then again,
he would lead the way at a good swinging pace, often
talking freely and even loudly with those behind.
All of a sudden, however, he broke off his conversation;
a gun-shot had sounded from some three miles away.
He held up his hand, and everyone stood breathless.
Presently he moved on again, but more slowly, for
several hundred yards, the rest gliding along in his
wake, and at last he stopped dead again. This was
the most irksome, or the most disciplinary, period of
the hunt, for the tyrannical leader kept everyone
standing motionless for quite ten minutes; and when
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_262' name='page_262'></a>262</span>
Weld merely took out his handkerchief to mop his
brow, the Indians nearest him eyed him as reproachfully
as though this were a penal offence.</p>
<p>The next thing the guide did was to fall flat on his
face, and each man mechanically imitated him&mdash;except
Weld, who had visions of a dislocated shoulder, if not
of a self-discharging gun, and who consequently performed
the man&oelig;uvre by degrees.</p>
<p>Now that his ear was so close to the ground, he could
plainly detect the uniform tread of a large body of
light-stepping animals, but he dared not risk spoiling
sport by raising his head to peer among the tree-trunks
in front of him. In a few minutes a gun went off,
half a mile to their left front, and was immediately
echoed by one to the right, and another well ahead,
whereat the trampling increased in speed and volume.
Immediately the leader raised his hand to a perpendicular,
and the redskins began to crawl on, worm-fashion,
in two diverging lines. Weld started awkwardly
to imitate them, but a strong hand caught him
by the ankle and held him still. Screwing his head
round, he saw that Strickland was his captor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold on,&rdquo; whispered the Major. &ldquo;We get our
fun from this side.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another three minutes&rsquo; silence followed, only broken
by the tramp of the approaching herd, slower now,
and more hesitating.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now then; roll away or crawl away to your right,
as far as you can, and as sharp as you can; and jump
up when I open fire,&rdquo; whispered the old soldier, and
Weld could see that, at a wave of his friend&rsquo;s arm,
all the Englishmen were swiftly separating. He
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_263' name='page_263'></a>263</span>
obeyed; but by the time he had covered a dozen
yards, he became convinced that the Indians had all
gone suddenly demented, for from every direction
there arose a succession of demoniacal yells that
almost drowned the crack-crack of the rifles that now
sounded on his left.</p>
<p>He leapt to his feet; not an Indian was in sight.
The white men, all standing up, were blazing away as
hard as they could, into an immense herd of bucks,
which were falling in numbers out of all reasonable
proportion to the shots fired. Then he discovered
that, from the other three sides, the Ojibewas, lying
in the long grass or crouching behind trees, were pouring
volley after volley of arrows at the bewildered
beasts, which, butting each other, were starting hither
and thither, completely panic-stricken.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Ware horns!&rdquo; shouted the Major&rsquo;s son as,
hurriedly butting his rifle, he felled an antelope that
had charged despairingly at him; and very soon
Weld was glad enough to follow the example, as a
stout young buck rushed, head down, in his direction.</p>
<p>More terrified now by the noise of the guns and the
sight of the white men than by the arrows and shouts
that proceeded from the other three points of the
compass, the herd turned to flee back towards the
hills. But this was only the signal for every Indian
to spring erect and brandish his long spear. That
effectually broke up the herd; the distracted creatures
squeezed a passage for themselves wherever they
could, and fled out of sight, leaving a good half of their
number to be carried back to the farm in the waggons
which were now on their way to the scene of the battue.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXI</h2>
<h3>CHIPPEWYANS AND COLUMBIAN GOLD-DIGGERS</h3>
</div>
<p>While human nature is what it is, the sudden
discovery of gold in any country must ever be
the signal for all the available flotsam and
jetsam and riff-raff of society to flock to that country,
in the sorry hope of finding a shorter road to wealth
than the old-fashioned one of steady plodding.</p>
<p>Before mining concerns were regulated by governments
or by syndicates, the edifying spectacle of men
wrangling and fighting over a claim or a &ldquo;find,&rdquo; like
dogs over a bone, might be witnessed at any hour of
the day. Add to this the constant disturbance between
the strangers and the original inhabitants, and you
have a condition of affairs which must quickly call for
some intervention by the State. This is what our
Government thought when, in 1857, the discovery of
gold in British Columbia began to lead to rioting
among the miners and to petty insurrections of the
Indians of the vicinity. In order to nip such disorders
in the bud, a few troops were landed near what
is now called New Westminster, on the Fraser River,
and a man-of-war, H.M.S. <i>Plumper</i>, commanded by
Captain Richards, was ordered to keep a watchful eye
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_265' name='page_265'></a>265</span>
on the river mouth. Rumour said that the ship had
been sent to hold the Indians in check; but Admiral
Mayne, who was then first lieutenant of the <i>Plumper</i>,
tells us that it was the white immigrants who required
handling, and that, but for them, the Columbian
Indians, who had long been quiet and inoffensive,
would have confined their attentions to their fishing
and farming.</p>
<p>One day, just at the beginning of winter, news was
brought to the ship that fighting was going on among
the miners and Indians at a camp near a small town
called Yale. The <i>Plumper</i> had a steam-launch which
was ordinarily used for river work, and an armed body
of bluejackets under Lieutenant Mayne at once put
off in a large pinnace for the spot&mdash;two miles higher
up&mdash;where she was lying in dock, with the intention
of hastening to the scene of the disturbance. To the
young officer&rsquo;s dismay, the launch had disappeared,
and, on inquiry, he learned that Colonel Moody of the
Engineers, who had been the first to hear the news,
had immediately put off in her with twenty-five men
and a howitzer. A mounted messenger was soon
dispatched back to the harbour and, in half an hour,
returned with orders from the Captain, for the firing-party
to hurry after the soldiers and offer their
services.</p>
<p>By nightfall the place was reached; a cheerless,
rugged spot where the crew had some difficulty in landing.
The pinnace was made fast to the launch, and,
following the directions of the men who had been left
in charge of her, the sailors marched quickly over a hill
and were soon at the diggings.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_266' name='page_266'></a>266</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve come too late,&rdquo; were the Engineer officer&rsquo;s
first words. He pointed to a group of prisoners, Indian
and white, who, under the guard of an armed picket,
were making themselves comfortable for the night.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve had a heavy day, though,&rdquo; continued Colonel
Moody; &ldquo;and three of my fellows have been badly
wounded. Your men pretty fresh, I suppose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give them half an hour for supper, and then I shall
want you to march them about ten miles across
country. I have guides ready for you. Come and
have something to eat, and I&rsquo;ll tell you all about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Colonel, a subaltern, and a regimental surgeon
had established themselves in a miner&rsquo;s hut, and here,
over a very unconventional meal, Mayne learned what
had happened. Scarcely had the soldiers put an end
to the rioting, when six Chippewyan Indians had
galloped into the camp. The miners at the next claim
had fired on them, they said; had threatened to burn
their winter fodder-stacks, and meant to drive them
out of their old settlement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, we&rsquo;ve only heard one side,&rdquo; concluded
Colonel Moody. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t trust your guides too far,
Mr. Mayne. Let one of them keep his horse, in case
you want to send me a message in a hurry, and make
the other five march between your men; they can
leave their horses here.&rdquo; He turned to the surgeon.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;d better go, too, Campbell; you may be wanted.
They&rsquo;ve a very good doctor here if we need him. Good-bye,
and good luck to you both.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The doctor buckled on his sword and Mayne collected
the sailors, placing five of the Indians in the centre,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_267' name='page_267'></a>267</span>
and all set off at a brisk step. The mounted redskin
led them some miles along a curving valley and then
across an open tract of country, whence they were soon
able to see the lights from some settlement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that the place?&rdquo; the lieutenant asked of a redskin
who spoke intelligible English.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; we have but four miles to go now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There seems to be plenty of light in the place; how
is that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Indian did not reply, but spoke in his own
language to his neighbour.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t understand them, do you?&rdquo; said
Campbell in a low voice. &ldquo;More do I, worse luck.
They seem to be very proud of themselves all at once.
If I were you, I&rsquo;d have an answer out of that chap.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The lieutenant laid his hand sharply on the redskin&rsquo;s
naked shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Answer the question, my friend. We don&rsquo;t want
all that mumbling and whispering.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man remained sulkily silent, but the Chippewyan
to whom he had spoken, a brighter, more
intelligent fellow, said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are pleased because our warriors have come
down from the mountains, and are burning the town.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your warriors&rsquo;ll get hurt, if that&rsquo;s their game,&rdquo;
said Mayne; and for a while nothing more was said.
But as they came nearer to the lights, the Indians all
began talking at the top of their voices, and Mayne
was obliged to call for silence. Presently the mounted
redskin stopped his horse, and a halt was called.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We had better go back, or wait for more warriors,&rdquo;
he said; &ldquo;we are too few.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_268' name='page_268'></a>268</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;What are you talking about?&rdquo; asked young
Mayne sharply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not the white men&rsquo;s camp that is burning,
but our own. It is clear that our brethren have not
come, as we had hoped. There are over seventy of the
miners, and you are but eighteen. They will massacre
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ride on, and hold your stupid tongue,&rdquo; said the
sailor. But the redskin suddenly struck his horse
across the withers and would have galloped away, but
that Dr. Campbell made a deft spring and managed
to seize the thong that did duty for a bridle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks, Doctor.&mdash;Now, my man, you get down
and march with the rest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mayne turned to his sailors. &ldquo;Can any of you lads
manage a leather jib-sheet?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, ay; let me have her, please, sir,&rdquo; volunteered
a young seaman. The guide was made to dismount
and the sailor began to lead the horse in the rear. After
a few minutes the Indians resumed their talk among
themselves again and&mdash;evidently taking courage from
the careless demeanour of the bluejackets&mdash;began to
handle their tomahawks more or less jubilantly, as
though waxing eager to be at their enemies; so much so
that the two officers held a muttered debate. They
had come out here to make peace; but if these savages
once saw themselves backed by resolute and well-armed
white men, they would never rest till they had
butchered as many of the diggers as possible. It was
a trying position for a young man who would be held
responsible for whatever evil might happen; and
Mayne, though he had gone through the Crimean War
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_269' name='page_269'></a>269</span>
with distinction, gaining his first lieutenant&rsquo;s step in
the Sea of Azov, was still only a lad of twenty-two.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What would <em>you</em> do?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Disarm the jolly lot, straight away,&rdquo; said Campbell,
who was his senior by a few years.</p>
<p>Mayne halted his men, explained the position to
them, and told the Indians what he and his colleague
had decided; and they, with many grunts of dissatisfaction,
gave up their arms on condition that
they should be restored if necessary for self-defence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know, <em>this</em> begins to look like business,&rdquo; commented
the surgeon when, within half a mile of the
glaring flames, a chorus of hooting, yelling, and singing
greeted their ears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>I</em> think it looks like advancing at the quick step,&rdquo;
said his companion; and he gave the order.</p>
<p>Very soon only a fringe of pine-trees separated them
from the scene of the tumult, and, as they reached
these, three men jumped up from the ground, and
cried:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who the blazes are you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Firing-party from H.M.S. <i>Plumper</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then git off back to your mothers and mind your
own business, afore ye git killed,&rdquo; hiccupped the first,
who carried a lantern in one hand and a revolver in the
other. The next moment he was lying on his back, for
Dr. Campbell had wrenched the pistol out of his hand,
and, with a single blow of his fist, had knocked him
clean off his feet. The second man put his hand in his
pocket, doubtless in search of a pistol, but, without
waiting to make sure of that, Mayne had him round
the arms and waist and was soon squeezing half the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_270' name='page_270'></a>270</span>
breath out of his body. The third man turned to give
the alarm, but a petty-officer sprang after him and
dragged him back by his shirt-collar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take away their weapons,&rdquo; cried Mayne as, with
a smart trick of the heel, he threw his captive violently
to the ground. &ldquo;No time for prisoners.&mdash;Forward!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A few steps more and the sailors were past the trees,
and in full view of all that was going on. And a pretty
sight it was. Thirty or more miners, many of them
delirious with drink, were capering round one or other
of the fuel and fodder stacks to which they had set
light; Indians and white men, to the number of a
score, lay on the ground dead or wounded; and,
beyond the stacks, was a heaving, struggling, shrieking
mob of miners and redskins, the former brandishing
knives and pickaxes, and shouting to their drunken
allies to come to their assistance; the latter spending
all their savage energies in defence of their homes and
families.</p>
<p>A whisper of indignant disgust ran through the
little knot of sailors; a fair and square sea-fight, or
even a &ldquo;set-to&rdquo; in a Portsmouth or Chatham slum,
was respectable in comparison with all this. The men
at the fires were the first to be aware of the new
arrivals; they broke off their dancing and, some awestruck,
others bombastic, lurched towards them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Halt!&mdash;Now listen to me, you sweeps, if you&rsquo;ve
got sense enough left,&rdquo; cried Mayne, drawing his sword.</p>
<p>The wild-looking, drink-sodden crowd&mdash;English,
German, French, and Yankee&mdash;ceased their babel for
a moment. But when they saw that the little force
consisted of only sixteen men led by what they considered
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_271' name='page_271'></a>271</span>
a couple of boys, their appearance became
mere matter for uproarious jesting; the noise broke
out afresh and was echoed by despairing wails from
the Indians in the background, who only saw a powerful
addition to their persecutors.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s your leader?&rdquo; shouted young Mayne.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s me, gov&rsquo;nor,&rdquo; said a tall Englishman, who
carried &ldquo;escaped convict&rdquo; in every line of his face.
&ldquo;All right, boys; they&rsquo;ve only come to lend a hand;
why, they&rsquo;ve got some Injun pris&rsquo;ners. Come on,
Lootenant; I was a seaman afore you was born.
Shake hands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The noisy ruffian came swaggering forward, and the
sailors breathed hard for a moment. Surely their
favourite officer would never stand that sort of talk.
Yet it was no time for words; these men were harmless,
compared to the other blackguards who were
trying to burn the Indians&rsquo; wigwams and huts over
their heads.</p>
<p>The lieutenant sheathed his sword and took a half-step
forward, at the same time clenching his left fist;
then let drive, straight at the digger&rsquo;s chin. The fellow
went down like a sack of flour, apparently stunned, for
he made no attempt to get up again. But immediately
several revolver-barrels flashed in the fire-light and
three shots were fired; a burning pain in his left arm
told Mayne that he was wounded, but the other shots
went wide. He stepped from in front of his men.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Open order!&mdash;Out of the way, you red men.&mdash;<em>Present!</em>&rdquo;
The rifles flew to the sailors&rsquo; shoulders
like magic. There was no time to be lost now; only
thirty yards away, Indians were murdering and being
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_272' name='page_272'></a>272</span>
murdered, and the shrieks of the women made the
young fellow&rsquo;s blood run cold. Yet he dared not place
his few men between two forces of desperate maniacs.
The rioters had again ceased their gabble.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hands up, every one of you.&rdquo; The lieutenant
waited for a few seconds. &ldquo;Make up your minds;
you&rsquo;ll not get another warning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>However mad the diggers might be, it began to
dawn on them that they could not hold their own for
three minutes against men who regarded fighting as
part of their day&rsquo;s work. Still they hesitated, for the
more curious or less pressed of the other body were
leaving the huts and coming over to them. They looked
from these to the sailors, in whose faces there was no
sign of wavering; already the officer&rsquo;s lips seemed to
be framing the word &ldquo;Fire!&rdquo; Then they could bear
the tension no longer. Some in ill-tempered silence,
the rest whimpering for mercy, threw up both hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dr. Campbell; take charge here till all arms are
collected; then join me.&mdash;Rear rank; &rsquo;tion! Left
turn. Trail arms. Double!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But when Mayne and his eight men reached the
wigwams, it was plain enough that it would be the
Indians who would give the trouble. They had at last
discovered that the white warriors were with them,
and now, though their disheartened assailants were
already ceasing to fight, other than on the defensive,
and were retiring as fast as they could get clear of the
crush, they began to strike with double fury, shrieking
their war-whoops, hacking and stabbing wherever they
could. Mayne gave a command, and every sailor slung
his rifle and drew his cutlass.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_273' name='page_273'></a>273</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Now separate them, lads.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The bluejackets dashed into the crowd with a cheer,
and good-humouredly flung themselves between miners
and redskins, employing fists, shoulders, and, where
necessary and practicable, the hilts or flats of their
cutlasses. By the time Campbell came running up with
his eight men, the wonder-stricken Indians had drawn
back, and were meditating on the apparent illogicalness
of their Queen&rsquo;s warriors.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Serve this lot the same as the others,&rdquo; said Mayne;
and those of the miners who had not fled were soon
holding up their hands, while the grinning sailors
crammed their haversacks with pistols and bowie-knives,
or stacked rifles and pickaxes out of harm&rsquo;s
way.</p>
<p>The Indian guides now asked for their weapons and
were curtly refused by Mayne, who, intimating to the
miners that they were now under arrest, made them
fall in, preparatory to a return to their own camp, which
was but a few hundred yards away. While the indefatigable
doctor was singling out the more sober and
respectable of these to help him in an examination of
the wounded of both parties, a German digger who had
fled came running back to the camp, hysterical with
fright.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Chippewyans!&rdquo; he screamed, clutching at
Campbell&rsquo;s arm, and sobbing convulsively.</p>
<p>There was no need to ask what he meant, for the
thunder of horses&rsquo; hoofs could already be heard, and,
by the time the sailors were brought to attention, the
wild war-whoop of a body of Indians was resounding
over the slopes.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_274' name='page_274'></a>274</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Our pistols. Give us our arms,&rdquo; roared the terrified
miners; and again the lieutenant found himself in an
uncomfortable predicament. Only a minute before, he
had been considering the advisability of disarming the
redskins in case of a treacherous attack during the
night. The new arrivals were mounted, and doubtless
strong in numbers; and, backed by the forty or more
Indians already present, they might easily be a more
powerful force than he could deal with. Already the
savages, seeing vengeance for their burning stacks
within their grasp, had gathered together and were
chattering and waving their war-hatchets.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t trust you with pistols,&rdquo; he said coldly, and
beckoned to him the most reliable of the Indian guides.
&ldquo;You must tell your people who are coming that the
White Queen&rsquo;s judges will punish these men. If they
attempt to do it themselves, they also will be punished.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Indian hurried away to repeat the message to
his chief, who appeared to be haranguing his warriors;
while Mayne spoke a few cheery words of caution to the
sailors.</p>
<p>A whistle from the doctor made him turn round.
&ldquo;Here they come. By George! how many more of
them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the shifting blaze of the stacks, the body of horsemen
who suddenly shot from among the trees seemed
to be at least a thousand; in reality, there were between
eighty and a hundred; some belonging to this camp,
but the majority of them braves from the Cascade or
other mountains, whom the messengers had hurriedly
collected. The unarmed miners huddled together,
shivering or cursing; while the seamen, with their
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_275' name='page_275'></a>275</span>
rifles &ldquo;shouldered,&rdquo; stood in a single line between them
and the advancing savages. At a sign from the chief,
the horsemen drew up and a palaver began.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on. You and I&rsquo;ll take a hand in this,&rdquo; said
Mayne. &ldquo;They seem to be in doubt. Where&rsquo;s our
interpreter?&rdquo; He and the surgeon walked over to the
chiefs, and, for some time, it seemed as though there
certainly would have to be bloodshed; for the Indians
who had come from a distance wanted value for their
money, and were not disposed to hear reason. But
presently the interpreter cut into the conversation,
reminding the chiefs that the &ldquo;warriors with no hair
on their faces&rdquo; had easily subdued a large body of
white men; and that, only ten miles away, there were
&ldquo;braves in red coats, with hair on their upper lips,&rdquo;
as well as a large number of miners, who would take a
speedy vengeance on them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell them, also,&rdquo; said Mayne, &ldquo;that unless they
agree to keep the peace, I shall give the miners their
weapons again, and we shall fight for <em>them</em>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His heart was &ldquo;in his mouth&rdquo; as he uttered this
high-sounding threat; for, of course, he no more dared
do such a thing than he dared head a mutiny on board
his ship. It was a chance shot; but it carried the day.
A buzz of conversation arose among the Indians of the
camp. Set those white fiends about their ears again?
They would fight their own allies first. An agreement
was speedily arrived at, and Mayne marched both
sailors and prisoners back to the white camp.</p>
<p>But it was an anxious night for him. His wound,
though only a flesh cut, was causing him great pain now
that the excitement of the evening was over; his men
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_276' name='page_276'></a>276</span>
were getting hungry and sleepy, and the doctor&mdash;no
less so&mdash;had his hands full with those whom the Indians
had injured; there were not a dozen miners who, in
their present condition, could be relied upon to fight if
need arose; and the redskins, to whom treachery was
as the breath of their nostrils, might, instead of keeping
faith, swoop down on the camp at any moment. But
sailors are used to short spells of sleep; sentries were
relieved every two hours; there was no more disturbance,
and by morning the diggers had come to a
rational and penitent frame of mind. How the quarrel
had begun was one of the things that will never be
found out; when white men allow the beast in them
to come uppermost, there is nothing to choose between
them and savages of any other colour. Before the day
was ended, Colonel Moody and a squad of soldiers had
arrived; the ringleaders on either side were on their
way to Vancouver for examination, and peace was
once more restored.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXII</h2>
<h3>THE CHIPPEWYANS OF THE COLUMBIAN MOUNTAINS</h3>
</div>
<p>In a former volume<a name='FNanchor_n0004' id='FNanchor_n0004'></a><a href='#Footnote_n0004' class='fnanchor'>[4]</a> the writer has related a
hunting adventure which befell the late Lieutenant
John Keast Lord; but, as the career of
this intrepid traveller was so full of romantic and
striking episodes, the reader may be glad to hear a
little more about him.</p>
<p>After his eventful mule-buying expedition into the
States, he returned to British Columbia, where he was
acting as naturalist to the Canadian Boundary Commission;
but he had no sooner reached New Westminster
than he found other instructions awaiting
him; this time, to report on the fauna of the coast
Ranges. This was in 1858, when already the Chippewyans
and Kuchins had been unsettled and rendered
ripe for assault and murder by the newly-arrived gold-diggers;
and Mr. Lord wisely decided to take with him
a bodyguard of half a dozen young Canadian hunters,
whose bravery, judgment, and fidelity he had many
times proved.</p>
<p>New Westminster was indeed new in those days; in
fact, it was not a year old; and much of the ride from
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_278' name='page_278'></a>278</span>
there to the Cascade Mountains was a pathless, hilly
waste, dotted with mountain-like rocks of granite, and
occasionally varied by chasms and cañons; and in this
cheerful neighbourhood many Indians who feared the
vengeance of the Government, for some of their various
crimes, had taken up their abode. The soldier-naturalist&rsquo;s
intention was to reach the seaward slopes of the
range, which had been but very little explored, and
were known to be covered to a great extent by dense
forests.</p>
<p>By the second day of his journey he had begun to
have serious thoughts of sending back at least three
of his companions, realising that a troop of seven
mounted men, fully armed, and accompanied by five
baggage-mules, had very much the appearance of a
punitive expedition on a small scale. Certainly this
must have been the view of the first few parties of redskins
with whom he met; for these either fled hastily
as though to warn their friends, or else defiantly
threatened the strangers with their bows or muskets.
Lord&rsquo;s absolutely perfect knowledge of the Athapascan
tongue, and of the character and customs of the
Chippewyans, was really the surest weapon of defence
for him to rely on now; and, bidding his men conceal
all arms but their rifles, and endeavour to look as much
as possible like a peaceful hunting or travelling party,
he resolved that, whenever they met with Indians, he
would get in first blow with his tongue and conciliate
the savages.</p>
<p>This very soon proved to be a promising plan; for
on the third morning, not long after the little troop
had begun its day&rsquo;s march, a score of Indians burst out
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_279' name='page_279'></a>279</span>
from the shelter of one of the huge boulders and, in a
chorus of wild yells, ordered the white men to throw
down their rifles. Signing to his companions to stay
where they were, Lord cantered across the strip of
broken ground, and, with no sign of anxiety, pulled up
before the noisiest of the Indians and gave him a laughing
good morning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you not yet learned to distinguish between
friends and enemies?&rdquo; he asked. The redskins ceased
their clamour and looked at each other in a puzzled
manner. They had been prepared for violence on the
part of the new-comers; or they would even have
beheld their meek surrender without betraying great
astonishment; but that the white leader should treat
them and their demands as a huge joke, and further,
should speak their tongue with an accent as pure and
natural as their own, were facts not to be grappled with
hurriedly. And, while they hesitated, Lord continued
airily, &ldquo;What do you fear, my brothers? We have not
come to hurt you. Why did you beseech us to drop our
guns?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have tracked some of our tribe from the mines,
have you not?&rdquo; said the chief cautiously, and more,
perhaps, to gain time than because he sought information.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; we have nothing to do with the mines, nor
do we wish to poach on your hunting or your fishing.
We are going to look for beasts in the forest on the
distant slopes. If you will guide us to a place where
we can cross the range with our horses and mules, we
will pay you well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To do him justice, though the Indian may be
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_280' name='page_280'></a>280</span>
treacherous, he is seldom a liar; consequently he is
less prone than the rest of the world to doubt another
man&rsquo;s word. From the chief&rsquo;s increasing hesitation it
was clear enough that he believed the Englishman&rsquo;s
statement, and was not unwilling to be friendly. All
the same, Lord&rsquo;s mind was not entirely at ease; none
of the Indians had horses; few of them had firearms;
and the covetous glances cast at his horse and his rifle
showed plainly enough that at least the majority of his
new neighbours would like the opportunity of robbing
him and his men. Some of them began to consult in
low tones, but he turned on these with a sudden
severity, partly assumed and partly real.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; he shouted. &ldquo;Do you make a stranger
of <em>me</em>? Do you exclude from your palaver one who
speaks your tongue; who has smoked the peace-pipe
and hunted with your brethren everywhere, from the
Nipigon Lake to these very mountains, and from the
white man&rsquo;s gold-camps to the country of the Apaches
and the Navajos; who has taught even the wisest of
your tribe; who can charm away pains in the jaws,
and can put new life into horses and dogs and cattle
when they are sick?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The muttered conversation broke off abruptly, and,
with some approach to deference, the chief explained
that it only related to the price which they should ask
for guiding the Big White Chief, and to the doubts that
some of them had as to the good faith of his followers.
The Big White Chief (he stood six feet four) answered
curtly that he would be answerable for his men, and,
by way of payment, would give a supply of tobacco
and rum to each Indian, and a revolver, with fifty
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_281' name='page_281'></a>281</span>
cartridges, to the leader. The last item clinched the
bargain in a moment, and the chief at once agreed to
show the way to a gorge through which the travellers
and their beasts could pass with ease to the other side.
This, he said, was more than a day&rsquo;s journey away;
if the white braves would stay the night at his camp,
which they would reach by sundown, he would undertake
to bring them to the gorge by noon on the following
day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go on, then,&rdquo; said the Englishman. &ldquo;I will inform
my men and we will follow you&rdquo;; and in a very
few words he explained the situation to the Canadians,
warning everyone to be on his guard.</p>
<p>The Indians, though laden with the spoils of a brief
hunting expedition, set off at a rapid jog-trot, seeming
quite heedless of the broken and ever-rising ground,
over which the white men&rsquo;s horses had much ado to
keep pace with them. At times this difficult road gave
place to a winding but well-worn track that seemed as
though it would eventually lead, corkscrew fashion, to
the summit of a mountain nearly ten thousand feet
high.</p>
<p>Some distance up this, Lord called a halt for dinner,
and, when it was ended, he had one of the mules disburthened,
and, with much show of friendly condescension,
insisted upon placing it at the chief&rsquo;s disposal for
the remainder of their climb. By this means he gained
as it were a hostage in case of treachery; for it would
be easy for one or other of his party to place himself
between the now mounted chief and the rest of the
Indians, with whom he had for a long time been carrying
on a mysterious and disquieting conversation in an
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_282' name='page_282'></a>282</span>
undertone. Lord was a poor hand at playing eavesdropper,
even had his life or liberty depended on that
form of acquiring information; but, from odd syllables
he had overheard from time to time, it had not been
difficult to gather that his guides had become two
factions, the one strongly disagreeing with the policy
of the other.</p>
<p>Late in the afternoon the path wound suddenly into
a thick grove of red and yellow cedars and Douglas
firs; and the half-muffled sounds of life in the distance
told the travellers that the Indian camp, or some
other, could not be far away. The sounds soon separated
themselves so that the barking of dogs, the blows
of an axe on a tree-trunk, etc., could easily be distinguished;
then lights peeped out among the trees,
and the chatter of women and screaming of babies
grew plainly audible.</p>
<p>Since he had been compelled to ride among the white
men, the chief had become more and more moodily
silent and ill at ease; and now the Indians ahead were
throwing apprehensive glances back, and renewing
their whispered arguments.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it? What do they fear?&rdquo; asked Lord of
the chief, who was then riding abreast of him.</p>
<p>He answered nervously, &ldquo;I will not deceive my
great brother. They fear lest you or your companions
should tell other white men what you will have seen at
our camp.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And if we did?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You would no longer be the red man&rsquo;s friend. If
harm should come to us through any of you, my tribe
would take a fearful vengeance.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_283' name='page_283'></a>283</span></div>
<p>The big veterinary surgeon laughed negligently, and
remarked that the chief need not be uneasy. Whatever
curiosity he might feel was soon to be satisfied;
for one more twist of the path brought them on to a
large clearing, dotted everywhere with fires and wigwams.
Lord had half expected to see a considerable
reinforcement of Indians here; and was much relieved
to find the camp guarded only by women and
six or seven elderly men.</p>
<p>The guides separated, each going to his own wigwam,
and the chief signified that the strangers would
be expected to share a banquet with him over his
particular fire. The food was good, the chief and his
own special cronies who sat with him very hospitable
and entertaining. Bed-time came, and two tents were
placed at the guests&rsquo; disposal, Lord, of course, arranging
a system of &ldquo;watches&rdquo; to guard against surprise.
But no surprise came; the night passed quietly and
peacefully, and the Englishman was at a loss to understand
the fears and suspicions of the Indians. But
while he was washing at a stream close at hand, one
of the Canadians joined him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got at their mystery, I think,&rdquo; he said in a
whisper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Chinese prisoners; three of &rsquo;em. I&rsquo;ve been talking
to one while you were having your breakfast. I take
it that this is a refuge-camp for all the rascality of the
neighbourhood. John Chinaman tells me that the
whole crew are &lsquo;wanted&rsquo; at Vancouver for sundry
attacks on the mining camps. Why, these are some
of the varmints who burnt Thomson&rsquo;s store last year.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_284' name='page_284'></a>284</span></div>
<p>Lord finished his ablutions and sat down to discuss
the position, which was certainly not a pleasant one.
In a sense, he was on his honour not to betray his
entertainers; yet, as a Government servant, it seemed
to be his duty either to arrest the chief or else lay information
against him. Moreover, though the few
Chinamen he had met had not impressed him favourably,
his blood boiled at the notion of slavery on
British soil, and of the unnameable cruelties to a
captive of which the redskins were capable. Before
he could arrive at any decision, however, a terrible
scream resounded through the camp, and both men
rushed towards the wigwams.</p>
<p>On the ground lay a Chinaman, pierced by an arrow,
and Lord saw at a glance that he was dead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The brutes,&rdquo; muttered his companion. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
the poor beggar&rsquo;s punishment for breaking out and
speaking to me.&rdquo; Lord called to his men and then
rounded on the chief, who was hurriedly approaching.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are the other two prisoners?&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;You must hand them over to me. I am a warrior of
the White Queen&rsquo;s, and can have every one of you
hanged.&mdash;No, no; I&rsquo;ll have no secret discussions. If
you disobey the Queen you are no longer my friends.
(Look out, you fellows!)&rdquo; In another moment he had
pulled a revolver from his pocket and was covering the
chief. &ldquo;I give you one minute in which to bring out
the other prisoners.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bows or muskets were hastily raised, but the
Canadians had unslung their rifles like lightning, and
were grouped behind Lord ready to fire on the first
man who dared to aim at him. The chief shrugged his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_285' name='page_285'></a>285</span>
shoulders, smiled, and ordered the prisoners to be produced.
They soon appeared, unbound but strongly
guarded, and, in pidgin English, told how, a few days
before, their camp near the sea had been raided, their
employers put to flight, and themselves brought away
to slavery.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you guide us to the sea?&rdquo; asked Lord. Yes;
they could. It was but a few miles distant. &ldquo;Very
well, then,&rdquo; he continued, turning to the chief. &ldquo;If
you will give me these men, and will swear by the
Great Spirit that you will not again trouble the white
men&rsquo;s camps, we will promise not to betray your
hiding-place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A rapid exchange of glances took place between the
Indians, and then the chief said emphatically:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I give up the prisoners, and I swear that my tribe
will keep faith with yours.&rdquo; Lord then swore to his
part of the bargain, and, anxious to escape from the
Indians at once, paid the guides and set off immediately
in the wake of the liberated prisoners.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you think about it?&rdquo; he asked the eldest
of the Canadians, when they were well on the road
through the wood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think they were a sight too ready to give way.
We haven&rsquo;t seen the last of &rsquo;em, I reckon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well; we shall be in open country directly, according
to the Chinamen,&rdquo; said Lord. He was disposed
towards a hopeful view, the more so that he had given
the Indians plainly to understand that they would pay
dearly for any attempt at treachery. Once or twice, on
looking back, he perceived men walking slowly behind
them, but as these were only armed with bows, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_286' name='page_286'></a>286</span>
made no pretence of secrecy, he took little notice;
and, in another hour, the wood came to an end. But
where was the promised gorge? The only path he
could see was a granite ridge, which on one side was
bounded by a stretch of rough rising ground, and on
the other became a precipice. The guides, however,
remained confident, and, after hinting that it would be
bad for them if they led him wrong, he followed them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; he cried suddenly, when they had
travelled about half a mile along the ridge in single file.
All reined up at a sound similar to that of a &ldquo;moose-trumpet,&rdquo;
or bark horn. Then they saw that three
Indians had appeared from the wood behind them, had
come to a stop on the edge of the cliff, and were looking
across the chasm towards a precipice twice the height
of that on which they stood. Evidently their trumpeting
was intended to rouse somebody across the chasm,
for two or three indistinct figures soon appeared on the
farther cliff. Then one of the Indians who had followed
Lord&rsquo;s party raised his arms and began to make signs
to those on the other side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Signalling, eh?&rdquo; said one of the men. &ldquo;Can you
read it, Mr. Lord?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The redskin was, in fact, transmitting a message
across the chasm, employing a system of telegraphy
similar to that used in Japan, or among our own
sailors: a form of &ldquo;deaf and dumb alphabet&rdquo; not
uncommon among the Indians of the hills and prairies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can read enough to see that these rascals are
warning someone to stop us,&rdquo; said Lord. &ldquo;Though
how they reckon to do that remains to be seen. Let&rsquo;s
get on as fast as possible.&rdquo;</p>
<div class='figcenter'>
<div class='figtag'>

<p class='caption'>
<span class='smcap'>A Primitive System of Telegraphy</span><br />
<br />
The Indians are able to transmit messages by movements of their arms and fingers at greater distances than the voice would carry. In this case the question is &ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; The answer &ldquo;Pani,&rdquo; transmitted from the lofty crags of a wide gorge.<br />
</p>
</div>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_287' name='page_287'></a>287</span></div>
<p>They moved swiftly up the ridge, till the ground
began to slope downwards again, and very steeply;
then a final bend brought them almost opposite the
mouth of the long looked-for gorge, which was wide
enough for all the horsemen to ride abreast in comfort.
The road was now beautifully level, and but that the
Chinamen would not risk their necks on mule-back and
knew nothing about horses, the whole party could have
galloped. The gorge proved to be some six miles in
length, and, at the end of a couple of hours, the
travellers knew that they had come to the outlet.</p>
<p>The fact was made known in a not very pleasing
manner, for all at once two musket-shots echoed down
the ravine, and the Chinamen, who were some ten
yards ahead of the horsemen, fell prostrate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Charge for it,&rdquo; shouted Lord, though he could not
as yet see the mysterious assailants. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t give &rsquo;em
time to load or aim&rdquo;; and the seven men, pistol in
hand, galloped to the mouth of the gorge.</p>
<p>Here they were greeted by a flight of arrows,
launched so hastily that no one was hit. The ambush
consisted of a dozen redskins, who, in obedience
to the signalling, had hastened round the head of the
chasm, easily arriving in time to cut off the more
slowly moving party. Fortunately, only two of them
had firearms; and the majority, seeing at once what
chance they would stand against mounted men who
were desperate and well armed, fled like chamois down
the slopes. Three of the party were, however, speedily
stopped by revolver-bullets from the horsemen, and so
rendered an easy capture.</p>
<p>Then the truth, or something like it, came out. The
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_288' name='page_288'></a>288</span>
Chinamen were gold-thieves who had escaped from
the mines and had fallen into the hands of the Chippewyans,
who cared nothing for their stolen gold but a
good deal for the labour which they would have been
able to extort from them. Lord had neither time nor
inclination to sift the matter. Finding that the Celestials
were not so badly injured but that they could
ride back to prison, he had them bound on to baggage-mules,
made the three wounded Indians mount behind
three of his men, and so conveyed all the prisoners in
triumph to the coast, where he handed them over to a
military picket for a journey to Vancouver jail.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIII</h2>
<h3>TWO DAYS IN A MOHAWK VILLAGE</h3>
</div>
<p>A very voluminous writer, and an explorer of
no small repute in Germany&mdash;Johann Georg
Kohl&mdash;has drawn up, from personal experience,
as exhaustive an account of the Mohawk section of
the Iroquois Indians as Surgeon Bigsby gave of the
Huron and Cherokee branches of that once powerful
family. Herr Kohl spent the years 1859-60 in travelling
about the north-eastern portion of the United
States and Southern Canada, and thus was able to
gather some interesting and valuable information
concerning the tribe, which the writers of story-books
seem to have maligned very much. He shows us
the Mohawks of Quebec as hard-working farmers,
respectable traders in fur, bold hunters, and pious
Christians; and he reminds us that there is nothing
extraordinary in all this if we take into account a
century and a half of French influence at its best,
together with the splendid labours of the Jesuit
missionary heroes.</p>
<p>From Lake Champlain, Herr Kohl travelled across
the boundary in a Canadian farmer&rsquo;s waggon, which
eventually set him down at an Indian village that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_290' name='page_290'></a>290</span>
stood on the verge of an immense pine-forest. To be
&ldquo;dumped&rdquo; down suddenly in a place where there is
not a single white person would be disconcerting
enough to any but a man of inquiring and adventurous
disposition; but Kohl, on learning from his companion
that here was a purely native population,
eagerly jumped out of the cart with his gun and his
luggage and bade the farmer drive on. Of course,
he was stared at; but so he would have been in an
English or German village; with this difference:
that these Mohawk women and children possessed a
native politeness and readiness to oblige that few
English and fewer Germans can muster up. Kohl
spoke encouragingly to the starers; was there an
inn in the place? he asked in French. No; there
was not. Where could he get a night&rsquo;s lodging then?
Anywhere in the village; perhaps the gentleman
would like to see the chief&rsquo;s house, as being the largest
and most fitting for his reception. A neat little old
woman called a youth who was repairing a timber-trolley.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go, my son; carry the gentleman&rsquo;s <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">paquet</i> and
show him the chief&rsquo;s house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The idlers drew back, and though they continued
to stare, made no attempt to follow the stranger.
He began to ask questions. Where were all the men?
The men were at work, a few in the fields, but most
of them in the forest&mdash;hunting, wood-lumbering, or
clearing the traps set for foxes, squirrels, etc.; many of
them would be home by sundown.</p>
<p>The German looked curiously up the little street;
nearly all the houses were on one side of it; on the other
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_291' name='page_291'></a>291</span>
there were but four buildings; the church, which&mdash;said
the lad&mdash;was visited three times a week by a
French <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">curé</i> from a neighbouring town; the school,
the chief&rsquo;s dwelling, and the &ldquo;assembly house&rdquo;&mdash;a
long wooden shed where public functions took place;
e.g. certain games and sports, the entertaining of
chiefs from a distance, tribal discussions, etc.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is where the chief lives, Monsieur,&rdquo; said the
Indian lad, pointing to a wooden hut about thirty
feet square, painted a dull red, with a bright yellow
door. The place was not architecturally beautiful,
to be sure; but it was the residence of the ruler of
the place; and, as the lad tapped at the door, the
traveller began to experience the same diffidence
that a stranger in London might feel in asking for
a night&rsquo;s lodging at Buckingham Palace.</p>
<p>A buxom serving-woman opened the door, and,
on the boy&rsquo;s explaining the visit, bade him bring the
luggage in and courteously asked the German to
follow her into the chief&rsquo;s presence. Kohl gave the
lad about a shilling&rsquo;s-worth of coppers, whereat both
he and the servant exclaimed. The man must be
a prince! A halfpenny would have been thought
a more than sufficient tip for such a task as the Indian
boy had performed.</p>
<p>The woman led the way through the house&mdash;which
was so ill-lighted, that anyone coming in from the
bright sunshine could at first see nothing&mdash;and out by
another small door to a huge space which seemed to
be cornfield, garden, meadow, and orchard all in one.
The back of the house was as tasteful as the front
was grotesque; the porch was covered with honeysuckle,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_292' name='page_292'></a>292</span>
now in full bloom, and all kinds of creepers
ran over the blank wall. In the middle of the garden
a man was digging early potatoes. He looked round
as the two walked up the path, and, to Kohl&rsquo;s surprise,
the woman introduced the potato-digger as the
Mohawk chief. When she had gone, the intruder
entered into explanations to which the chief&mdash;a
bright-eyed, gentle-looking old man&mdash;listened with
polite attention.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are very welcome,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We country
people are always glad to see visitors and learn all
their news; strangers seldom come this way now;
they go over there instead&mdash;they travel by the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chemin
de fer</i>&rdquo;; he pointed westwards, where, fifteen miles
away, ran a line of railroad. &ldquo;But&mdash;it must be an
awful thing to go about the country like that, sir.
I myself have never been in a train, thank God.&rdquo;
He spoke the ordinary Canadian <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">patois</i>, though he
evidently understood Kohl&rsquo;s Parisian French quite
well.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You do not travel far, I suppose?&rdquo; said the
white man gently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; I am over eighty years of age. But in my
time I have been far, very far. I have traded and
fought with the <i lang="moh" xml:lang="moh">Inwi</i>&rdquo; (Eskimos); &ldquo;I have guided
white hunters through Ungava; I have seen steamboats
and railway trains.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While he was speaking the old gentleman shouldered
his fork, picked up his potato-basket, and turned
towards the house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will like some refreshment. We do not dine
till my sons return.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_293' name='page_293'></a>293</span></div>
<p>They entered the house again, and, as soon as
Kohl&rsquo;s eyes were accustomed to the gloom, he saw that
it was simply one large room. The floor was of planks,
beautifully clean; and the walls were almost entirely
hidden by the skins of various animals; these certainly
made for snugness in winter, stopping the draught
that otherwise would have come through the chinks;
but the effect was more startling than artistic, for
some ambitious soul had dyed or painted most of
them, a magnificent elk-hide being daubed with
alternate stripes of green, red, and yellow, while a
black bear-skin had little yellow crosses painted all
over it. Two of the walls were partitioned off into
a sort of loose-boxes, each six feet wide; these were
the bedrooms; the light came through a hole in the
roof (which was also the chimney) and from two small
windows, where a clumsy attempt had been made at
fitting ready-made sashes into openings that were
anything but &ldquo;true.&rdquo; Near the door hung a crucifix
and holy-water stoup, not ill-carved in wood; but
this was the only attempt at civilised wall-decoration.</p>
<p>The woman whom Kohl had imagined to be a
servant came bustling forward with a platter of cakes
and a basin of cider, which she pressed on the visitor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is my youngest son&rsquo;s wife,&rdquo; said the chief.
&ldquo;I have three sons, and they and their wives live
with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And their children?&rdquo; asked Kohl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only one girl; all the others are married; and
she is to be betrothed to-morrow. To-morrow we
keep holiday; there will be much dancing and ball-play
and feasting.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_294' name='page_294'></a>294</span></div>
<p>Then they fell to talking of the old man&rsquo;s early
days. He could remember the time when it was
still quite a new thing for the English to be regarded
by the French colonists as anything but tyrants; he
had heard his father talk of seeing the white soldiers
of General Wolfe; he himself had fought against the
Sioux many times. Bah! the Sioux were bad men;
cruel men, who would not keep faith.</p>
<p>His reminiscences were so engrossing, that Kohl
lost all count of the time, till the sound of footsteps,
voices, and horses&rsquo; hoofs past the house told him that
the men were returning from their day&rsquo;s work. The
eldest son, the future chief of the tribe, now entered.
He was a very tall, lithe man, between fifty and sixty,
less formal in his manner than his father, but quite
as modest and agreeable. He had been superintending
the carting of the hay from some distant meadows
which he owned; and Kohl could not refrain from
smiling at the talk that went on between father and
son. He had come out here prepared to see bloodthirsty
robbers and torturers and bear-slayers; and
behold, the chief dug potatoes, and the chief&rsquo;s son
performed his ablutions in a bucket of water, and
talked of the hay-harvest and the amount of cider
consumed by the mowers that day, as if he were in
Kohl&rsquo;s native Bavaria. He was now almost ready to
see a telegram or a Munich newspaper brought to the
door.</p>
<p>As soon as the other sons returned from their
hunting, two of the women dragged a deal table from
one side of the room, and all sat down to supper.
This was the first time that Herr Kohl had seen the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_295' name='page_295'></a>295</span>
women sit down with the men; here it seemed a
recognised thing. The unmarried granddaughter&mdash;a
pretty girl of seventeen&mdash;did most of the waiting,
and that by helping an enormous stew of onions, beef,
chickens and hare from the pot on to wooden
platters, and handing them round. Forks were not used.</p>
<p>After supper they all adjourned to the benches
outside the house. The visitor had brandy and cigars
in his portmanteau; and, while he handed these
delicacies round, another surprise greeted him; the
chief was a teetotaller! and even the sons partook
very sparingly of the brandy, though they appreciated
the cigars as having a flavour of town life. He was
beginning to understand now why there was no inn
in the place. The street was the village public-house.
Men sat and smoked outside the huts, or strolled up
and down in twos and threes; some even squatted
in the middle of the road. To-night, as there was a
stranger in the place, a knot of Indians stood looking
on from a respectful distance at the chief&rsquo;s party;
and presently, most of the elders of the tribe came
and sat or lounged near the chief. Each of these
greeted the stranger with a guttural &ldquo;Bon soir,
M&rsquo;sieu&rsquo;&rdquo; (one or two of them promoted him to &ldquo;Monseigneur&rdquo;).
Had they forgotten their own language
even? For a while the talk was of the morrow&rsquo;s
festivity, and a tall young brave, whose face was
indistinguishable in the twilight, was introduced to
Kohl as the future bridegroom; but this topic soon
flagged, and the traveller guessed, from the general
turning of faces towards him, that it was &ldquo;news&rdquo;
that everybody wanted.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_296' name='page_296'></a>296</span>
Before he had talked many minutes he had become
a personage; for he had read and travelled widely,
and had the rare knack of being able to suit himself
to whatever company he happened to be in. He
could tell the redskins nothing of Quebec City, for
he had not been there; but what pleased them more
than anything else was his talk of England; he had
once stayed in London; had even seen their White
Queen. They wanted no fresher news than that,
though it was more than three years old; and they
let him talk till his head was nodding with sleep.</p>
<p>After a night passed in one of the loose-boxes and
between two bear-skins, he rose early and started off
to the woods with the three sons of the house, who had
to clear some traps a few miles away. For some time
their talk mystified him, for they continually spoke
of the animal for which the snares were set as <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">le chat</i>.
He knew that wild cats were almost unknown so far
north, and the tame ones could scarcely be so plentiful
in a pine-forest as to need trapping. He asked for an
explanation, which his companions laughingly gave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We call him that because it is easier to say than
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">le loup cervier</i>; many of the French trappers call him
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">le lynx</i>. It is only lately that we have taken the
trouble to catch him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How is that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must catch what the fur-dealers ask us for, sir.
Just now, they tell us, the white people in the towns
are very fond of wearing lynx-skin as part of their
dress.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When they arrived at the line of traps the Bavarian
perceived that the Mohawks&rsquo; progressive notions extended
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_297' name='page_297'></a>297</span>
even to these, for they were steel gins bearing
the trade-mark of a Montreal hardware firm. In all,
ten well-grown lynxes were taken from the traps, which
were reset and baited with fresh meat. Then the four
hungry men sat down to their breakfast of cold meat,
barley bread, and cider, and chatted gaily over it,
finding far more rational matter that they could discuss
in common than the average English gentleman
would often find in conversation with three average
English peasant-farmers. Yet Kohl, who had a healthy
admiration for the fighting-animal in man, was becoming
conscious of a certain melancholy as he looked at
his companions. Of course, a Mohawk who went to
church, paid his taxes, and sent his children to school
was a more desirable neighbour than one whose merits
were reckoned according to the number of human
scalps in his possession; still, one could almost have
wished&mdash;&mdash;</p>
<p>He got no farther with these reflections, for, just
then, something happened that upset all his fine
theorising, and proved conclusively that there is something
in the old saying about scratching a Russian
and finding a Tartar. All in a moment the Indians
dropped their cider-horns and sprang to their feet,
shouting:</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i lang="moh" xml:lang="moh">Musquaw! Musquaw!</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was almost the first native word he had heard,
and it meant a black bear. Peering among the trees,
he at length caught sight of a large animal hastily
turning his back on them and preparing to beat a retreat.
The Mohawks ran in pursuit like deerhounds,
though all of them were over fifty years of age. Their
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_298' name='page_298'></a>298</span>
rifles&mdash;modern breech-loaders&mdash;lay to hand ready
charged, but they left them behind; those were all
very well for money-getting, but just now it was sport
that they wanted. Kohl picked up his own gun and
hastened after them. They were shouting at the top
of their voices&mdash;and in Iroquoian; reviling the bear,
daring him to turn on them, and taunting him with his
cowardice; in a word, hunting as their fathers and
grandfathers had done before them. Each had slipped
a formidable-looking hatchet from his belt, and now,
as they came up with the fugitive, the youngest brother
dealt him a blow across the haunches that made him
stop and bellow with pain.</p>
<p>As a rule, the <i lang="moh" xml:lang="moh">musquaw</i> is a perfectly harmless beast
if left alone; but, when he turns to bay, he is as
ferocious and almost as strong as a grisly. Maddened
and almost maimed, the great brute now reared, and
so suddenly, that the eldest Indian, who had been
aiming a similar blow to his brother&rsquo;s, lost his balance
and fell with his head actually touching the beast&rsquo;s
back as he rose on his hind feet. But this was only
matter for laughing; he was up again in a second,
and striking for the back of the bear&rsquo;s head, while
his brothers sprang backwards or sidewards with
terrier-like activity, dodging his outspread claws and
awaiting an opportunity to bring him down with a
blow across his snout.</p>
<p>Kohl had now reached the scene of the combat,
and took up a position whence he could easily cover
the enemy with his rifle, which he had just loaded
with ball. But the Mohawks wanted no such help
as that.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_299' name='page_299'></a>299</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;No; don&rsquo;t fire, we would kill fifty like him,&rdquo;
screamed André, the second brother; and, as he
spoke, his hatchet fell, cleaving the forepart of the
great creature&rsquo;s skull. The blade stuck fast, and it
was only by letting go of the haft and taking a tremendous
backward spring, that he saved himself
from the paw that struck out at him almost automatically.
The bear was tottering now, and another blow
on the back of the head from the Indian behind
brought him down, stone-dead. Other redskins,
attracted by the shouting, had now left their traps
and come up, and to these was given the task of
flaying the carcase and bringing home the skin;
while the chief&rsquo;s sons, happy as a boy who has killed
his first rabbit, went back for their guns.</p>
<p>When they reached the village again, they found
it <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en fête</i>. On the wide space between the chief&rsquo;s
house and the church, all the inhabitants had collected
to do honour to the hero and heroine of the day; and,
coming out from the house, were the chief, a French
priest, and all the womenfolk of the family.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come along,&rdquo; cried the old man gaily to his
youngest son; &ldquo;we are only waiting for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then ensued a quaint mingling of ancient and
modern Mohawk custom. Much of the success of
Catholic missions probably lies in the fact that the
clergy have never opposed those traditions and customs
of savages which were in themselves innocent; here
was an instance. A girl was about to become engaged
to her future husband, and there was no difficulty
in grafting on to the Indian ceremony the medi&aelig;val
religious rite of betrothal.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_300' name='page_300'></a>300</span></div>
<p>The chief&rsquo;s youngest son, the girl&rsquo;s father, approached
the lover, carrying a bow and four arrows.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My brother,&rdquo; he said solemnly; &ldquo;you have asked
to have my daughter for your wife. But, before you
can take the bird to your own nest, you must catch
her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He fitted an arrow to his bow and shot it so that it
stuck in the ground about a hundred yards away.
Then, amid dead silence, he stuck a second arrow
in the turf at the young man&rsquo;s feet, and, taking his
daughter&rsquo;s hand, led her to where the first arrow had
dropped. He shot a third arrow, this time high in
the air, and it fell about twenty yards away from
where the girl was standing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you try to catch my bird?&rdquo; he shouted to
the bridegroom-elect; and of course received &ldquo;yes&rdquo;
for an answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then fly,&rdquo; and he shot his fourth arrow as a
signal for the start.</p>
<p>It was queer handicapping&mdash;a hundred yards start
out of a hundred and twenty&mdash;but the girl had doubtless
made up her mind beforehand. After hurrying
off at full speed, in coquettish pretence of wishing to
escape, she contrived to stumble, fell on her face,
lay there till the happy man was within a yard or
two of her, and allowed herself to be caught before
she reached the goal. Of course, the ceremony was
a survival from a time when an Indian girl received
no other intimation of the wishes of the man who
wanted her for his wife, and might reasonably wish to
bestow her hand on some other suitor&mdash;in which case
here was an escape for her; but the result of the race
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_301' name='page_301'></a>301</span>
was received with as much applause as though everything
had been real earnest.</p>
<p>Immediately afterwards, everyone went into the
church; the lovers stood at the altar, and the priest
read the short betrothal office (<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Fiançailles</i>) which had
been introduced by the early French settlers. Games
and dancing followed; not the genuine Indian dancing
which Kohl had hoped to see, but a rough imitation
of the French peasants&rsquo; dance; and the day ended
with a great feast in the assembly house.</p>
<p>Kohl was obliged to proceed on his way in the
morning, but he made many subsequent visits to this
queer little community, and always found himself
treated like an old friend.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIV</h2>
<h3>CANADIAN LAKE AND RIVER INDIANS</h3>
</div>
<p>The Athabaskan or Athapascan family of Indians
may be found anywhere between Alaska and
Manitoba, and some of the more unsettled or
enterprising tribes have even wandered as far as the
Mexican boundary. In Southern and Western Canada
they are principally represented by the Kuchins and
Chippewyans, hardy hunters, canoemen, and fighters,
many of whom are to this day very unsophisticated in
their views and habits. In the &rsquo;sixties, Canada still
knew little about railways; lakes and rivers were the
recognised highways of travel, and the Eastern Chippewyans
made a steady income as carriers, boatmen,
and guides; to which occupations, says the Rev. C.
Colton, they applied the same combination of energy
and deliberateness that their tribe has always displayed
in its hunting or its warfare.</p>
<p>Mr. Colton was rector of an Anglican Church in New
York, and, in 1860, he set out to visit some friends who
lived on the Saskatchewan River&mdash;a journey similar
in point of distance to that from London to Moscow, or
Palermo to Dublin. After a stay at the famous Niagara
Falls, he embarked at Buffalo for Detroit, which meant
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_303' name='page_303'></a>303</span>
a three-hundred-mile run across Lake Erie; then made
his way to Port Huron, whence a little steamer would
carry him to Port Arthur, Ontario.</p>
<p>The morning before the boat came in sight of this
place, he observed quite a swarm of Indians on the
near bank, leaping into their canoes in the greatest
excitement; none of them had guns or bows, but&mdash;which
looked neither promising nor peaceable&mdash;every
man had, either beside him or in his hand, a long, barb-headed
spear. Indians had, on many occasions,
paddled out to the steamer, but it had always been
with the sole object of selling fruit or furs or fish, and
this was the first time that Mr. Colton had seen them
carrying weapons of any sort.</p>
<p>He asked the master of the boat what it meant; but
neither he nor the engineer could account for the
demonstration; and the four negroes who formed the
crew showed by their restless motions and their inattention
to everything but the three or four dozen
canoes that were flocking towards the launch, that
they were considerably alarmed. The only passengers
besides the clergyman were three ladies, and a Canadian
journalist named Barnes, who was returning to the
British Columbian gold-diggings, and who, like the
rest, did not know what to make of the sudden and
rapid approach of the Indians.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re Chippewyans,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;And, by the
look of it, they mean to board us. Have you got a
&lsquo;gun&rsquo;? Then take this one; I&rsquo;ve another in my
bag.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look out for yourselves and your baggage, gents,&rdquo;
cried the Yankee skipper, producing a six-shooter.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_304' name='page_304'></a>304</span>
&ldquo;They mean to hold us up. Ladies, please go into
the cabin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Colton was dumbfounded. One minute they
had been gliding easily along with no more thought of
piracy or highway robbery than you have when on a
Thames penny steamer; the next, a revolver had been
thrust into his unskilled hands with the recommendation
to &ldquo;look after himself.&rdquo; It was too absurd, yet
decidedly awkward; and it would not be a mere case
of driving off the canoes by a distribution of grapeshot,
but&mdash;unless their engine was more powerful
than Chippewyan paddles&mdash;of being outnumbered by
about ten to one and robbed of every cent and every
thing they possessed, even if not killed.</p>
<p>And worse was behind all this. Why on earth was
the boat stopping instead of steering out? Stopped it
certainly had, and a cursing match was in progress
between the infuriated master and the engineer. In
their excitement they had, between them, managed to
run the steamer on to a pebble-bank. A yell of delight
arose from the Indians; their paddles flashed through
the water with greater rapidity than ever, and in
another minute the canoes were round the steamer&rsquo;s
bows, the paddles dropped, and the spears picked up.</p>
<p>Colton had never fired a pistol in his life, but, like
many of his cloth, he had a very pretty notion of
using his fists when need arose, and he took his stand
fearlessly by the side of the journalist, determined to
sell his life dearly. Barnes regarded the matter coolly;
he had had many a brush with Indians, and had more
than once &ldquo;stripped-to&rdquo; and thrashed an offensive
digger.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_305' name='page_305'></a>305</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;What do you want? What&rsquo;s your game?&rdquo; he
shouted to the redskins in their own dialect.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look; look!&rdquo; cried the skipper. &ldquo;Do they conclude
to stave her in?&mdash;What is it they say, Boss?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sure enough, every Indian was stooping low, spear in
hand and point downwards, earnestly studying the
water, and as much of the boat&rsquo;s underside as they
could distinguish. A conversation was proceeding
meanwhile between Barnes and the Indian nearest
him; and all of a sudden the journalist fell back into
the arms of the skipper, choking and convulsed with
laughter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>Say!</em>&rdquo; remonstrated the skipper mildly. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
keep it all to yerself, Squire; if they don&rsquo;t mean mischief,
what the plague <em>do</em> they mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>Sturgeons!</em>&rdquo; gasped the Canadian. &ldquo;Oh, my
aunt! Somebody&rsquo;s been plumbing them up that the
&lsquo;fire-canoes&rsquo; are towed along by great sturgeons.
Look at the noble savages.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With breathless anticipation, every Indian was
gravely watching the water round the bows, ready in
an instant to plunge his spear into the first sturgeon
that came handy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wal,&rdquo; said the skipper, &ldquo;even then their intentions
wasn&rsquo;t more&rsquo;n middlin&rsquo; benevolent, I allow. How
did they calc&rsquo;late we&rsquo;d make any way when a neefarious
gang had cleared out our propelling gear for us&mdash;<em>s&rsquo;posing</em>
we was towed that way? You&rsquo;d better
argufy with &rsquo;em, and bring that p&rsquo;int home to &rsquo;em,
Mr. Barnes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After another conversation the journalist turned to
the master.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_306' name='page_306'></a>306</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;ll pay out one or two tow-lines, skipper,
they&rsquo;ll soon have us off this. I&rsquo;ve told them it&rsquo;s their
fault we ran aground, and that, if they don&rsquo;t tow us
off, we shall report them at the next cavalry depôt,
and they&rsquo;ll get hurt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>No time was lost in throwing over four tow-warps,
and the Indians, much impressed by Barnes&rsquo;s representation
to them of the measure of their iniquity,
considered themselves let off very cheaply. The
canoes were divided into four lots, one to each rope,
and as soon as they had &ldquo;tailed-on&rdquo; one to the other,
the four long teams paddled with a will, and the
launch&mdash;no bigger than a Brighton fishing-smack&mdash;was
towed free without the least difficulty.</p>
<p>Only too glad to fall in with a companion who, in
addition to being a decently educated man, undoubtedly
&ldquo;knew his way about,&rdquo; Mr. Colton readily
agreed to the young Canadian&rsquo;s becoming his companion
as far as his destination. He still had a very
long journey before him, but the newness of all his
surroundings and the beauty of the country made it
seem all too short. Sometimes they got a lift in a
farm-waggon or were able to hire horses as far as the
next water-way; failing these, they walked, sleeping
at night at a farmhouse, or sometimes in the forest;
and in this way they came to the Lake of the Woods,
whence they would be able to travel all the way by
water to the Saskatchewan River, where the clergyman&rsquo;s
journey ended.</p>
<p>They reached the lake early one morning after
having passed the night at a fur-agent&rsquo;s house on the
Minnesota boundary; and, before they were aware of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_307' name='page_307'></a>307</span>
it, they had walked straight into a camp of wandering
Chippewyans, who had been resting on the lake shore
for a few days before returning northwards from disposing
of their furs. Evidently they were used enough
to meeting with white men, for, beyond a cheery
&ldquo;good morning,&rdquo; they took no further notice till the
strangers addressed them; and then it appeared that
several of them spoke English or French. They had
just finished their breakfast, for the fires were still
smoking, and cooking utensils and broken food lay
about the ground, though most of their other property
had already been stowed in the canoes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We also want to reach the Saskatchewan,&rdquo; said
Barnes, when they mentioned their destination.
&ldquo;What reward do you ask for taking us there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The braves conferred in a low voice, and at last the
chief said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will take you there, and feed you by the way,
for five dollars each&rdquo;; which meant that, for a guinea,
a man might travel four hundred miles by water, in
beautiful weather, and be fed for a whole week at the
least. Colton was about to offer them more, but his
companion checked him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give them what you like extra at the end of the
journey, but we must haggle now, or they&rsquo;ll think
we&rsquo;re worth robbing&rdquo;; and he actually had the face
to beat the redskins down to three dollars a head,
money down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did you get for your furs?&rdquo; he asked, when
his terms had been agreed to. They named a sum
which was a disgrace to the white agents, for it meant
that they had bought skins which the Indians had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_308' name='page_308'></a>308</span>
toiled for months to get, and had brought all the way
from the Saskatchewan, for a sum that would yield
about five hundred per cent profit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see?&rdquo; he whispered to his companion.
&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve no idea of values, poor chaps; a few dollars
seem a gold-mine to them; and then, when a man
comes along and offers an honest price without any
bating, ten to one he&rsquo;ll be robbed and murdered because
they think he&rsquo;s a millionaire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the day was rapidly coming when unscrupulous
persons could no longer defraud the savages; writing
only ten years later, an English traveller deplores the
extortionate charges made by the redskins for even
the most trifling service, and points out that he could
have bought furs in Regent Street as cheaply as they
would sell them to any private individual.</p>
<p>The two travellers paid their money, of course prepared
to add liberally to it at the journey&rsquo;s end, and
their boat was pointed out to them. The canoes were
most of them very large, and capable of seating a crew
and a family. The one assigned to the white strangers
was manned by a chief and five braves; the other
men, with their wives and children, distributing themselves
pretty equally between the remaining canoes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How will they get these down? Or are they going
to leave them?&rdquo; asked Colton, pointing to the huts,
or lodges, as Barnes called them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get them down? You might as well talk about
taking home empty wine-bottles and lobster claws
after a picnic. They may take the matting, but I
doubt it. They can make and erect a hut in less than
an hour.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_309' name='page_309'></a>309</span></div>
<p>Hitherto the only Indian dwellings they had passed
had been huts, or else the well-known wigwams made
of grass-cloth, or coarse linen; but these &ldquo;lodges&rdquo;
were very different. They were nearly dome-shaped;
more strictly, they were octagonal with a convex roof,
and were constructed by eight long, slender rods of
some flexible wood being stuck in the ground at equal
distances; the tops were bent down till they met or
overlapped, and then bound securely together with
vegetable fibre. Lengths of bark, cut from the paper
birch, were tied over these to form a roof; and the
sides were made, in some cases by hanging strips of
matting from pole to pole, but more commonly by
erecting thatch walls, speedily improvised with fibre
and bundles of wild rice stalks, which grew like rushes
in the shallows. No attempt was made to remove
them, and they were left to the next comer&mdash;an altruistic
practice which had its reward; for other
wandering Indians had done the same thing higher up
the lake, and more often than not, when the flotilla
stopped for the night, there was a camp of ready-made
tents awaiting the travellers.</p>
<p>All that week the two adventurers lived, like the
proverbial fighting-cock, on the fat of the land:
sturgeon, salmon, woodcock, wild-duck, venison, eggs,
and sometimes fruit, were all to be had for the asking;
for, though the Chippewyans had no guns, they had
spears and arrows and quick sight. The boat&rsquo;s crew
were decent fellows, who soon lost their taciturnity and
suspicion when they found the passengers kindly and
conversationally disposed; and they made no demur
at being asked, from time to time, to turn out of their
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_310' name='page_310'></a>310</span>
way a little, that Colton might explore one or other of
the channels, side-creeks, and rivulets that form part
of the complicated water-way between Minnesota and
the Saskatchewan.</p>
<p>On one of these experimental cruises, the explorers
found themselves in an adventure which missed little
of ending tragically. Barnes suggested following a
little stream that appeared to run parallel to the main
channel, and the Indians, who, of course, knew almost
as little about the byways of the vicinity as their
passengers, were not unready to indulge their own
curiosity; if the stream did not bring them into the
open water again, they could soon turn back. The
banks were low and sparsely wooded, and suggested
little in the shape of either game or human habitation;
but these features did but add to the romance of the
scene, and the two travellers were well content to go on;
more particularly when they saw that ahead of them
the banks promised to rise mountains high.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are coming to a cañon,&rdquo; murmured an Indian
lazily. All the better; Mr. Colton had never seen a
cañon worth the name.</p>
<p>Gradually the speed of the canoe quickened, and
the rowers&rsquo; labours became proportionately lighter;
so much so that the chief looked grave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must go no farther,&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;With a current
like this, there must surely be rapids ahead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then here&rsquo;s one who&rsquo;s for going back,&rdquo; said the
Canadian, who knew, far better than his companion,
what this might imply; shooting low rapids in small
canoes, with Indians who knew every inch of the
way, was all very well; but who could say that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_311' name='page_311'></a>311</span>
there was not a second Niagara within a few miles
of them?</p>
<p>The Indians at once rested on their paddles, only to
find that this did not greatly arrest the progress of the
boat. For once, curiosity and indolence combined had
got the better of their characteristic wariness. The
chief signed to the white men to move to the other end
of the boat, for there was no difference in the shape of
her bows and stern, and, the weight properly adjusted,
she could be worked either way and needed no turning.
But even while they were obeying, the canoe moved
swiftly on again; two of the Indians, in the confusion,
had had their paddles swept from under them for a
moment by the water, the canoe swerved a little more
towards midstream, and was at once caught in an
irresistible current.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No good; we must take our chance now,&rdquo; said the
chief. The note of something approaching despair in
his voice was not comforting to his hearers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come; we must make some effort,&rdquo; said the clergyman
briskly. But his friend shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Leave them alone; they won&rsquo;t miss a chance.
They know they may do more harm than good with
their paddles in a wash like this.&mdash;I say; this <em>is</em>
going it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The canoe was fairly held by the tide now, and the
utmost that could be done was for the chief and the
bowman to keep her head straight. The banks flew
by at an appalling rate, rising higher and higher till
they formed an imposing cañon. Suddenly Barnes
whistled under his breath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you hear?&rdquo; he said.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_312' name='page_312'></a>312</span></div>
<p>The distant rumble which had hitherto passed unnoticed,
or at least unconnected with coming danger,
was swelling to a thunder roll that could only proceed
from a mighty rapid. Their plight was only too horribly
apparent now; in the ordinary course of events,
nothing could save them from the destruction awaiting
them, and to attempt to make matters better by trying
to reach the smoother water under either bank, would
only be to make that destruction quite as sure and
much more swift. And the black dots ahead, where the
current split into forty currents and joined again
beyond; what were they? Rocks, beyond a doubt.
That being the case, it was not easy to understand
why the chief&rsquo;s morose expression suddenly grew
brighter. He made a motion with his head, and one of
the braves picked up and loosened a coil of rope,
muttering words in dialect to the other canoemen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O-ho! Sit tight,&rdquo; whispered Barnes.</p>
<p>The Indian had doubled his rope, so that the bight
formed a loop-noose; and now, on his knees across the
bottom of the boat, with the three unoccupied canoemen
ready to bear a hand at a quarter of a second&rsquo;s
notice, he was watching a spike of rock that rose two
or three feet above the torrent, between which and a
flat islet of stone, the current was bearing them.
Colton involuntarily half closed his eyes; safety was
so near now; yet so sickeningly doubtful. Now they
were up to the passage. At any rate, the bows had not
dashed on to either rock. Now they were through.
Only a few yards beyond was a ghastly vision of
boulders&mdash;a whole bed of them, over which the torrent
surged and bubbled, and which they could never hope
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_313' name='page_313'></a>313</span>
to pass. He opened his eyes wide again. If they were
alongside the little pinnacle of rock, why did the
Indian still remain motionless?</p>
<p>But, at that very moment, the lean brown arm shot
past his head, as though the brave had struck at him;
the three waiting Indians fell almost on to their faces
grasping at something; there was a jerk that brought
a frightful spasm of pain to the face of the man who
had thrown the rope, and the boat had come to a stop.
The bight had fallen over the splinter of rock, and
already the ends of rope had been made fast to
the canoe by the three waiting redskins, while the
fourth held the double line together till the chief had
bound the two cords with a thong, so completing the
noose.</p>
<p>The men could now take enough breath to enable
them to realise that, so far, their case was not much
better than it had been. As long as the line held, they
were in no danger of being dashed on to the rocks, or
beyond, to the distant rapids; but they could never
paddle back; and, though there was a little food in the
boat, they must starve to death in a few days if they
stayed here.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>There&rsquo;s</em> the way out,&rdquo; said Barnes confidently,
after a lengthy silence.</p>
<p>Ay; it was a way out, but only such as a man of
strong nerve could follow. They who dared might
leap on to the flat rock on the other side of the canoe,
walk across it, and, by a series of jumps, from one to
another of the three stepping-stones beyond, reach a
low spit of rock that ran out from the cliff foot; and
from there the face of the cañon might be scaled with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_314' name='page_314'></a>314</span>
tolerable ease, in one place, by means of a series of
ledges and boulders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will climb up and examine,&rdquo; said one of the
redskins; and he leapt lightly across the awful current
and began his walk over the rocks, the rest watching in
breathless suspense. In half an hour he was back
again, with the report that the top of the cliff was a
narrow, barren hill, sloping gently down on two of its
sides; would they not do well to abandon the canoe
and walk back to the lake shore?</p>
<p>This course did not recommend itself to anyone;
least of all to the white men, who could not afford to
leave their baggage behind. The only other plan was
to land, drag the canoe as far as possible out of the
current and into the fringe of smoother water, and then
tow her; and this they agreed to adopt. Five of the
redskins were to climb up to the cliff-top, carrying a
tow line, and the remaining one was to stay behind and
steer.</p>

</p>
</div>
<p>Barnes and Colton were for accompanying the
Indians; but when he came to face the six-foot leap
over that roaring torrent, the clergyman, who was no
longer young or very active, felt that in his case it
would be sheer suicide to attempt the jump; and he
stayed behind with the steersman. In so doing he
well knew that he was not choosing the safer course.
For, the moment the mooring rope was removed, the
boat began to kick frightfully, and water was soon
streaming over her bows. He caught up a copper pot
and began baling for dear life, till the sweat ran out of
him and his arms grew weary, and till the water had
ceased to flow in. Then he looked up at the other men;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_315' name='page_315'></a>315</span>
there they were, fifty or sixty feet above him, straining
like horses going uphill, in their effort to fight the
current below. What wonder that he looked almost
despairingly at the tow-line&mdash;a wretched contrivance
hastily rigged up by joining together all the ropes and
thongs that the canoe contained? How long was
it going to stand the mere strain, let alone the sawing
and chafing that it must get from every abutting rock?
At such a time a man can do no more than keep a stiff
upper lip, and humbly leave his fate in the Hands that,
for wise purposes, made Nature at once as beautiful
and as terrible as she is.</p>
<p>Suddenly the rector was aroused by the chief&rsquo;s voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can paddle! Yes! You see!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The men at the top had paused for breath, but the
line was no longer so horribly taut, and the fact that
the chief was beginning to propel the boat at least
sufficiently to cause the rope very soon to sag, showed
that the worst was over. In due time she was towed as
far as the low bank and the six men were taken aboard;
but Mr. Colton never again trusted himself down a
strange river with canoemen who knew no more about
it than he.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXV</h2>
<h3>A WALK ABOUT URUGUAY</h3>
</div>
<p>Taken as a whole the Indians of Uruguay are&mdash;and
have ever been&mdash;a brave but peace-loving
people, engaged principally in sheep and cattle-rearing.
No doubt the mildness of their character
and pursuits is largely due to considerations which
are purely geographical; for the sea and the Uruguay
River together make the country almost an island,
to which the Argentine and Brazilian Indians would
never venture to penetrate. Further, there are&mdash;apart
from the native cattle&mdash;no large or fierce wild
animals.</p>
<p>The latter fact is by no means generally known;
and ignorance, or doubt of it, led the late Thomas
Woodbine Hinchcliff to take a trip across from Buenos
Ayres to the little state in the hope of finding jaguars,
pumas, or other animals more worthy of a sportsman&rsquo;s
gun than those which he had seen round about
Buenos Ayres.</p>
<p>Mr. Hinchcliff was a London barrister, but is better
remembered as the first president of the Alpine Club,
and the man who did more than any of his contemporaries
to popularise mountaineering. In 1861,
while touring in South America, he went ashore from
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_317' name='page_317'></a>317</span>
a Uruguay River steamer, quite alone and with only
provisions for a couple of days, determined to explore
one of the mountain forests, and, if possible, to reach
San José, the largest of the inland towns.</p>
<p>A fourteen-mile walk across a well-wooded plain
brought him in sight of a Gaucho farmstead, where
he was made very welcome and persuaded to stay
the night; and it was here that he learned the futility
of attempting to find any big game shooting in the
country, and that there was nothing special to see
at San José.</p>
<p>In consequence, he altered his course in the morning,
making direct for the most accessible of the mountain
forests, and, arrived here, he wandered about with
the ecstasy of a man who has discovered an earthly
paradise. It was the Amazon forest over again,
with all its beauties and advantages and none of its
drawbacks; a climate similar to that of Algiers, a
wealth of fruit and flowers and streams and birds;
and no deadly swamps, no suffocating heat, no jaguars
or alligators, and apparently no snakes. He made
his dinner of fruit and continued his wanderings, with
a result that he might well have foreseen: when night
came, he was utterly lost. He slept sweetly enough,
however, under a tree, and after a hearty breakfast,
continued his wanderings.</p>
<p>By evening he came to an outlet, and found himself
on an undulating grass plain, but, as no habitation
was in sight, he finished his provisions and philosophically
resigned himself to another night in the fresh air.</p>
<p>He awoke early, conscious of two things; the one
that he was hungry, the other that a beast whose like
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_318' name='page_318'></a>318</span>
he had never seen, in or out of a show, was gravely
inspecting him from a distance of a few feet. Was
it a bull, or a bison, or a nightmare? Without question
it had the body of a bull, but the face was far more
like that of a bull-dog, for the nostrils were placed
high up, and the lower jaw protruded in such a fashion,
that the teeth showed ferociously, whether the mouth
was closed or open.</p>
<p>He reached for his gun, which he had laid ready
loaded on going to bed; the beast looked well capable
of goring or trampling him to death at less than a
minute&rsquo;s notice. But even while, half sitting, half
lying, he took aim for the creature&rsquo;s eye, a general
lowing sounded from farther down the hill, and the
bull turned and ran swiftly down the slope. The
bewildered Englishman arose and was now able to
learn the cause of the lowing. A dozen mounted
Indians were in the valley, their horses standing
motionless, while two more, approaching from the
left and right sides of the hill, were seeking to frighten
a small herd of the remarkable-looking animals into
the valley. The bull, no doubt the recognised protector
of his tribe, whom curiosity had betrayed into
a momentary neglect of duty, had heard the bellowings
of alarm, and was hastening to the defence of his
kindred.</p>
<p>But even as he charged wrathfully down the hill,
the nearer of the Indians made a motion with his arm,
and he fell with a crash that was distinctly audible
to the spectator above; while the second Indian,
spurring his horse and bawling at the top of his voice,
rode straight at the retreating cattle; these, of course,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_319' name='page_319'></a>319</span>
became panic-stricken and ran helter-skelter down
towards the spot where the unruffled horsemen were
awaiting them with lassoes. From his vantage ground,
Hinchcliff watched the proceedings with breathless
interest. For a minute or so a whole maze of lassoes
showed against the background of the next slope,
curling and twirling; then the herd fled, some right,
some left; some to rush away out of sight, others
to be pulled up in mid-career by the fatal thong that
had been deftly thrown over their horns; and so
suddenly and sharply, that in most cases they fell
to the ground.</p>
<p>The Englishman walked quickly towards his particular
bull, which lay roaring piteously, but the animal
was up again before he could reach him; the Indian
had dismounted, slipped a noose over the roarer&rsquo;s head,
and untwisted from his forelegs what Hinchcliff at
once recognised as a <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">bolas</i>&mdash;three thongs of equal length,
the upper ends joined, the lower loose, and each
terminating in a ball of metal or heavy wood.</p>
<p>The redskin, whose only garment was a pair
of loose-fitting trousers made of deer-skin, looked
inquisitively at the stranger and gave him a respectful
&ldquo;good morning&rdquo; in Spanish; adding to the bull,
which was beginning to toss his head and stamp,
&ldquo;Useless, old friend; useless; we have coveted you
this many a day,&rdquo; and even while he spoke he
vaulted across his horse and started away at a breakneck
speed, dragging his captive after him, willy-nilly.</p>
<p>By the time the pedestrian reached the valley,
the prisoners seemed to have become sullenly reconciled
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_320' name='page_320'></a>320</span>
to their fate, for they were making no attempt
to struggle, and some had even begun to crop the grass
at their feet, leaving their captors free to inspect the
stranger. Hinchcliff told them, in Spanish, that he
had lost his way and wanted some breakfast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is many miles to our town,&rdquo; said the young
man who had caught the disturber of his peace;
&ldquo;but we shall breakfast here when we have made
our cattle fast. You are welcome to share our food.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His companions echoed the invitation, and, the
cattle being secured to the neighbouring trees, the
Indians seated themselves by a pool and shared their
breakfast of chocolate-cake, bread and beef with
their guest, who now began to notice the queer bulls
and cows more closely. The hind legs were markedly
longer than the front ones, and, whenever they moved,
they seemed to be looking for pasture, for they persistently
kept their heads low and their necks sloping.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We call them <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">niata</i>,&rdquo; was the reply to a question
of his. &ldquo;The best and youngest will be kept for
breeding; the rest will be slaughtered for <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">carne seca</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Carne seca</i>, the very meat to which the hungry
Englishman was doing such abundant justice, is beef
dried in the sun; and for the last fifty years, Uruguay
has been exporting immense quantities of it all over
South America. The <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">niata</i> cattle are peculiar to
Uruguay and La Plata, and are probably the only
kind indigenous to South America.</p>
<p>When breakfast was finished, the question naturally
arose, whither did the señor wish to be guided? In
point of fact, the señor had seen quite enough of the
woods and hills for one while, and lost no time in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_321' name='page_321'></a>321</span>
making up his mind that he would like to visit their
village, provided there was some means of riding
there.</p>
<p>One of the Indians pointed to his horse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Neither of us is very heavy; you can ride behind
me. If you hold by my waistband you will be perfectly
safe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was a method of locomotion new to the explorer;
but now that the morning was growing warm and he
was away from the shade of the forest, it would be
decidedly preferable to walking; and he meekly
mounted behind this good Samaritan.</p>
<p>At starting, the cattle became obstinate for a while;
but superior force and intelligence prevailed; the
horses were not the deplorable scarecrows of the
Argentine, but stout, well-fed animals, that understood
the business of catching and driving refractory
bulls as well as their masters; and they closed in on
the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">niata</i>, hustling them with knees and shoulders,
till they were glad enough to walk in sober fashion.
All the same, the journey to the Indian town was not
to be entirely void of adventure. Outside the village
was a stream some forty feet wide, deep, but easily
fordable in some places; and this would have to be
crossed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We always swim our horses across,&rdquo; said Hinchcliff&rsquo;s
companion; &ldquo;but if we have cattle with us,
it is safer to go a little out of our way to this ford.
Why, good Lord! only last year one of our men was
killed&mdash;cut nearly in halves, if the señor will believe
me&mdash;through a bull hanging back on the bank after
his horse had started to swim. The horse took fright,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_322' name='page_322'></a>322</span>
and backed so that the man got the lasso drawn round
him and&mdash;Bah!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cattle and horses plunged into the water and all
landed safely on the other side without more ado,
except the horse that carried the two men. Whether
it was that he was less used to the water, or was
merely restive at the unaccustomed weight, it was
impossible to say; but, when he was about a fifth
of the way across, he stopped and began to kick; and
the Englishman, with the gruesome story of the man
who was sawn through by a lasso still in his mind,
felt that he was in no enviable position.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sit tight, Señor,&rdquo; shouted the Indian, putting the
bridle into his hand and jumping down so suddenly,
that Hinchcliff had barely time to clutch at the saddle
and steady himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep his head straight; don&rsquo;t let him jib.&rdquo;
Then water began to splash liberally in the face of
the disobedient horse, which immediately plunged
forward, stopping whenever the splashing ceased.
The Englishman could not refrain from throwing an
inquiring glance over his shoulder, and then he was
very much tempted to burst out laughing; for the
Indian, up to his shoulders in water, was grasping
the animal&rsquo;s tail with one hand, and beating the
water into his face with the other. And so, with
much patience, horse and rider and helmsman landed
on the other bank.</p>
<p>The town, its inhabitants and their actions, were
very much what Hinchcliff had seen in Brazil and
the Argentine; very orderly and simple and not too
cleanly. The people refused to take any money for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_323' name='page_323'></a>323</span>
their hospitality, and it was only with difficulty that
he persuaded the chief, on bidding him good-bye
the next day, to accept a small sum to hold in trust
for any one of his subjects who might happen to be
in want. The truth is, that where they have not been
demoralised by white people, savage tribes are usually
simple enough in their habits; none of them is ever
in want, and poverty, as understood in civilised
countries, is almost unknown. A man works (or,
more properly speaking, makes his wife work) not
for a fixed sum, but for the necessaries of life merely;
and the Indian tribes, whether of North or South,
have little of the insatiable cupidity of the Asiatic
or the negro.</p>
<p>After a night in the village, Hinchcliff set out to
find his way back to the river by a different route,
avoiding the woods and endeavouring to follow a
faintly-marked horse-track over the grassy hills.
This procedure nearly led him into a difficulty far
more serious than that of losing his way in a luxuriant
forest, for he missed his road and got on to one where
there was no sign of a stream, and where the pools
had nothing but dry mud to offer him, so that he went
all the afternoon and night without tasting a drop of
water. He woke before daybreak, almost delirious,
and set off at the best pace he could contrive for some
low-lying land, which he had failed to notice overnight.</p>
<p>All at once a strongly built Indian started up from
the ground fifty yards in front of him, and, after one
look at him, began to flee down the hill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop! I want you; I want water,&rdquo; shouted
Hinchcliff.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_324' name='page_324'></a>324</span></div>
<p>The fleeing figure turned its head as though straining
to catch the words, but still ran on. Then the thirsting
man grew desperate, and, determined to make the
man help him to find water, raised his gun and pretended
to take aim at him. Immediately the fugitive
stopped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Water!&rdquo; shouted Hinchcliff. &ldquo;I have lost my
way, and am dying of thirst.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Indian appeared to reflect for a moment, and
at last made towards his pursuer, disengaging a large
water-gourd from his belt as he walked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What made you run away?&rdquo; panted the Englishman,
when he had emptied the gourd at one draught.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I saw your gun and I was frightened. We do not
like <a name='TC_4'></a><ins class="trchange" title="Was 'fire-arms'">firearms</ins>, Señor; and here in the lowlands we
seldom see white men.&mdash;You have lost your way,
you say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; I want to reach the river.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am going that way and will show you it; it is
but a few miles. But first, with your permission,
I will finish what I was doing when I caught sight
of you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He sat down, and from a round wooden box, began
to cover his fingers liberally with a lard-like substance
which he proceeded to rub over his face, shoulders,
breast, arms, and waist.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have been much indoors, lately; sick,&rdquo; he
explained; &ldquo;and the insects trouble me greatly.
They will not sting through this ointment. Some of
our more ignorant people use mud instead; but I&mdash;I
have lived in towns at times; I am more learned.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Indian was, in truth, a very intelligent man,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_325' name='page_325'></a>325</span>
and Hinchcliff found him a most interesting companion.
He soon discovered a stream where they
could drink their fill; he asked questions about the
weapons that had frightened him so much, and even
so far overcame his fear of <a name='TC_5'></a><ins class="trchange" title="Was 'fire-arms'">firearms</ins> as to offer to
carry the gun a little way; an offer that was declined
with thanks. When the wonderful instrument brought
down a fine young ostrich for dinner, the unsophisticated
fellow actually put his lips to the barrel. Quick
to turn his hand to any open-air work, he plucked
and cleaned the bird and collected sticks and dry
pampas grass for the fire; whereupon another
surprise awaited him; for Hinchcliff was growing
very short of matches, and was in the habit of economising
them by using a burning-glass for lighting his
pipe and his fire. And this was the only occasion
on which an Indian ever asked him for anything,
even indirectly; on receiving a hint that his companion
would give the world to possess such a wonderworking
implement, he handed it to him readily
enough; for, if necessary, he could easily use one of
the lenses of his field-glass for getting a light.</p>
<p>Shortly before sunset, as the two trudged along
towards the river, which had long been in sight, the
Indian, after a sudden glance behind him, set off
at a sharp run, making for a tiny valley that opened
between the hills on his left.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>Now</em> what?&rdquo; shouted the astonished Englishman.
As he turned to look back, the sound of approaching
horses caught his ear, and he saw an Indian and three
Gauchos riding at full speed, followed closely by a man
who rode like a European. They wheeled for the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_326' name='page_326'></a>326</span>
valley at once, and reached it long before the fleeing
Indian, who turned back shrieking towards Hinchcliff.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shoot, Señor; for the love of all the Saints;
shoot them dead; they are bad men,&rdquo; he gasped in
an agonised voice.</p>
<p>This was rather a large call on a man who came
from a country where to shoot people is a capital
crime; but the piteous appeal for help in the fugitive&rsquo;s
face was irresistible. If an Englishman is averse to
taking pot-shots at strangers, he is generally quite
as loth to see the weaker side go to the wall. While
he was asking himself what was the best thing to do,
the foremost Gaucho made a sudden motion with his
arm, the noose of a lasso dropped over the Indian&rsquo;s
head, and he was jerked over on to his back. At
sight of the bulging eyes of the half-strangled victim,
Hinchcliff pulled out his knife and was about to slash
the thong through, when the second Gaucho, springing
to the ground, flung himself in the way and presented
a pistol.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are acting under orders,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Be
careful what you do.&mdash;All right; loose him and tie
his hands, Juan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are sure that&rsquo;s your man?&rdquo; asked the
European stranger, hurrying up. He had spoken in
such execrable Spanish, that Hinchcliff said unceremoniously:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Englishman, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; I am British vice-consul for this district.
Question for question&mdash;is this a friend of yours?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; merely a paid guide; but&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you don&rsquo;t know that he is the cleverest
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_327' name='page_327'></a>327</span>
thief and prison-breaker in Uruguay, if what these
fellows say is true. I only met them by accident a little
higher up; but I know it&rsquo;s a fact that an Indian
prisoner broke loose from San José gaol the other day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no mistaking <em>him</em>,&rdquo; said the man who
was binding the prisoner. &ldquo;But let the tracker
decide.&rdquo; (A &ldquo;tracker&rdquo; is an Indian who hires himself
out as a sort of blood-hound, to catch horse-thieves,
stray cattle, etc.) &ldquo;He knows him well enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>No mistake had been made; the simple&mdash;but
teachable&mdash;Indian was the man who was wanted;
and a most respectable barrister of the Inner Temple
had spent a whole day chatting affably with a notorious
criminal, who would assuredly have robbed him of
his gun and money had the opportunity arisen.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVI</h2>
<h3>THE EXPLORATION OF THE SALADO VALLEY</h3>
</div>
<p>When poor Charles Mansfield made his journey
up to the unknown Chaco, he passed, on his
way, a district equally unknown at that time:
the valley of the Salado River, which remained unexplored
till 1863, when Hutchinson, the African
traveller, traced the river to its source. Thomas
Hutchinson, <span class='smcaplc'>F.R.S.</span>, had been appointed British Consul
at Rosario in 1862, and, before leaving England, had
been instructed by the Foreign Secretary (Earl Russell)
to take the first opportunity of exploring the Salado
and its basin, and to test the truth of the report that
the Indian territory there abounded in wild cotton.</p>
<p>It was not till the following year that he could spare
time for a task which might occupy an indefinite
period; and then he ascended the Parana by steamer
as far as Parana City, rode across to Santa Fé, which
is on the Salado River, and there began to make inquiries.
Generally, a man on such an errand finds
plenty of people ready to pour cold water on his
schemes and to draw his attention to innumerable
obstacles; but this time the reverse was the case.
Though he could find none of the inhabitants who had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_329' name='page_329'></a>329</span>
ever been more than a few miles higher up than Santa
Fé, when he returned to his hotel that evening, the
landlord informed him that a gentleman who was now
in the smoking-room had just arrived by private
steamer from Buenos Ayres, and had been asking the
same question as himself: did anyone know anything
of the upper part of the Salado?</p>
<p>The stranger was one, Don Ruberta, a young
Argentino engineer who had studied in London; he
had been making a survey of the Colorado and Rio
Negro, and aspired to do the same on the Salado. He
proposed starting on the following morning, and at
once begged the Consul to accept the hospitality of his
little launch; and so it came about that outlying
Guaranis, Quiteños, and Chiquitos were enabled to
behold a steam vessel&mdash;and probably an Englishman&mdash;for
the first time.</p>
<p>The crew, which consisted of a Portuguese engineer
and three Zambos, were as ignorant of the neighbourhood
as their employer; but the main charm in river
exploration lies in the fact that, so long as rapids, or
dilemma-like forks, or mud-banks do not intervene, you
have but to follow your nose. On the first day they
passed sundry Indians in canoes, but these evinced
no excitement or curiosity. Don Ruberta had divided
his coal into two parts, and meant, if necessary, to
steam for as long as the first half held out. At night
the vessel stopped from dark till dawn, to avoid mud-banks,
and in order that the explorers might miss
nothing that could be of importance. By the middle
of the second day they came to a <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">rancheria</i>, or collection
of Gaucho huts, standing about a mile back from the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_330' name='page_330'></a>330</span>
left bank; and, as it looked as if some valuable information
might be obtained here, the two men landed
and strolled up the hill.</p>
<p>The place was a very large horse-farm, but the
Gauchos could tell them little or nothing of what they
wanted to know, for their trade was all with Santiago
or Cordoba, and they never had occasion to use the
river. But one of the employés, a Quiteño Indian who
hailed from the Bolivian frontier, said modestly that
he could tell the señors all they needed to know about
the river.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then will you come with me as pilot for a few
days?&rdquo; asked Ruberta.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will come&mdash;that is, if you are well armed. For
there are wild people higher up, who eat man&rsquo;s flesh;
they run from guns, but they do not fear arrows
unless there are many bowmen. Then, too, there are
the river Chiquitos, who may blow poisoned darts
at us unless we keep them at a distance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>No objection was raised by the Gauchos, to whom
Hutchinson gave a small money present, and the
Indian retired to &ldquo;pack up.&rdquo; The luggage with
which he very shortly reappeared was doubtless
cumbersome; but then it comprised all that he needed,
whether for a journey to the United States, or for
setting up housekeeping permanently. Over his
shoulders were slung bow, quiver, blanket, lance, and
copper pot; in one hand he carried a hatchet, a
bundle of lassoes, and two bolas; in the other, some
spare thongs, a well-seasoned paddle, a pair of stirrups,
each as big and wellnigh as heavy as the skidpan of
a waggon-wheel, the sharpened angles of which did
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_331' name='page_331'></a>331</span>
duty for spurs; while at his belt hung a knife and a
<a name='TC_6'></a><ins class="trchange" title="Was 'deerskin'">deer-skin</ins> pouch, the latter containing flint and steel,
palmetto-leaves, tobacco, and a little bag of dried
<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">maté</i>. Happy Quiteño; he was ready for any emergency;
whether fighting, boat-building, horse-catching,
or beast-slaying! Of the launch he had not much
opinion; if it did not sink with all that weight of
machinery, it would catch fire at any moment;
nothing would persuade him to sleep in the tiny
forecastle with the Zambos, and he passed the night
wrapped in his blanket on deck.</p>
<p>The <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">rancheria</i>, he said, was the last civilised spot
they would pass, for Tucuman was many days&rsquo; journey
away from the water; so was Salta; and, after that,
the river became only a stream, running through
the territory of the Aymaras. The cotton he knew
nothing about, which, from Hutchinson&rsquo;s point of
view, was awkward, as it would mean many landings
and perhaps many fruitless searches.</p>
<p>The next morning the Consul woke soon after dawn,
to find the guide peering through the hatch of the
little after-cabin where he and Ruberta slept.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The man-eaters have come,&rdquo; whispered the
Quiteño; &ldquo;they have been watching us all night,
I suppose. If you bring your gun you can kill many
of them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hutchinson went on deck and looked towards the
nearer bank, which was about eight yards away.
Crouching behind the reeds were some fifty Indians.
He called out to them in Spanish; they made no
answer, but slunk backwards a few steps up the slope,
so bringing themselves into full view. They were of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_332' name='page_332'></a>332</span>
medium height, stark naked, with no ornaments
whatever, and armed only with short spears. The
explorer had seen Niger savages and Fuegians, but
neither had the debased, abject look of these men.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Speak to them in your tongue. Tell them we
mean no harm,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>The Quiteño obeyed, and it was plain that they at
least partially understood him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The dogs!&rdquo; he said scornfully. &ldquo;They think
our boat is alive. May I kill them, Señor?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rubbish. Tell them I and my friend are coming
on shore after breakfast.&mdash;Ah, Señor Don; here are the
cannibals, you see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do they say?&rdquo; asked Ruberta, laughing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The dogs!&rdquo; reiterated the guide. &ldquo;They say
that my people kill and eat them;&rdquo; and he would
have unslung his bow, but that Hutchinson stayed
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell them we will do them no harm, and that we
are only coming to look for flowers; but that if they
attempt to injure us we shall kill them.&rdquo; This menace
was more to the Indian&rsquo;s taste, and he delivered the
latter part of it with unction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They say they are not afraid of <em>you</em>, gentlemen,
because you have no bows. It is I whom they fear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The crew had now come on deck, and at their
appearance, one by one from the bowels of the boat
as it were, the savages retreated still farther. The
Zambo cook, as usual, laid the explorers&rsquo; breakfast
on deck.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s test them with a little Christian diet,&rdquo; said
Ruberta, flinging a bunch of bananas towards the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_333' name='page_333'></a>333</span>
inquisitive crowd, who at once scrambled for it.
Those who succeeded in getting one of the fruits ate
it greedily, rind and all, which told a tale: there
was no fruit about here, and the savages, not having
energy or courage to travel, had never tasted such a
delicacy. Hutchinson cut off a thick round of cold ham
and threw it after the bananas. The man who captured
it took a big bite, and while he coughed and spluttered
at it, his neighbour snatched the remainder from
him, and was soon coughing in like manner. They
had never tasted salt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Try them with bread,&rdquo; said Ruberta to the cook,
who took a steaming cake from his frying-pan and
threw it on the bank. But no one picked it up.
Already the smoke from the engine-funnel had surprised
if not terrified them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They think it is alive,&rdquo; said the Quiteño, &ldquo;because
it steams. They are not men, Señors; they are
monkeys; they do not understand half what I say
to them, and I suggest that your excellencies should
kill them all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hutchinson had already taken it for granted that
they did not understand all that was said, for accustomed
to listening attentively to uncivilised speech,
he had detected in theirs that continual repetition of
certain sounds, which argues a scanty vocabulary.
When breakfast was finished he filled his pipe, and
Ruberta rolled up a cigarette; this brought the
Indians a pace nearer again, and made them stand
on tiptoe; but when one of the white men struck a
match they sprang back again, and, at sight of
the smoke issuing from the strangers&rsquo; lips, they set
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_334' name='page_334'></a>334</span>
up a chorus of little shrieks that suggested even more
fear than surprise; and was repeated with double
vigour when the Quiteño and the crew also &ldquo;lit up.&rdquo;
That an Indian, of all people, had never seen smoking
told a tale in itself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now draw in, Pedro,&rdquo; said Ruberta to his engineer,
who backed his engine, making towards a natural
landing-place which had been observed on the previous
night. &ldquo;Diego; tell them once more we will not
hurt them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Quiteño repeated the message, which seemed
to be received with indifference; but, as he leapt
ashore, every spear was poised, and levelled at him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come back. Ask them what&rsquo;s the matter,&rdquo;
said Hutchinson.</p>
<p>Diego jumped back to the deck.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are saying that I want to kill them with my
spear and arrows.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then, let them see you lay them down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cannot go without my arms, Señor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stupid fellow; borrow Señor Pedro&rsquo;s revolver,
but hide it in your pouch; if they see it, they&rsquo;ll
want it, because it shines.&rdquo; Then the explorer, versed
in the ways of such people, held up a string of bright
beads. He might as well have held up a turnip, for
all the excitement or cupidity it created; and some
scarlet cloth met with no better reception.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall I try them with these, Señor?&rdquo; said the
Zambo cook, coming aft with a small basket of yesterday&rsquo;s
fish which he had been keeping for bait.</p>
<p><em>That</em> they understood; their eyes brightened a
little&mdash;a very little; and, as the half-breed threw
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_335' name='page_335'></a>335</span>
each raw and anything but fresh fish to them, it was
scrambled for and greedily devoured.</p>
<p>The Quiteño now jumped a second time; the
Indians started distrustfully, but did not threaten
him with their spears, and the two white men followed
him, their hands prudently on their hidden revolvers.
The savages chattered excitedly, but still made no
offensive motion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ask them about the cotton, Diego,&rdquo; said the
Argentino. &ldquo;Tall yellow flowers, with purple spots,
tell them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yellow? What? Flowers? We eat them,&rdquo;
was the lucid reply which Diego obtained.</p>
<p>The truth was, the poor wretches were so degraded
and helpless, that apart from obeying such elementary
instincts as eating and killing, they knew nothing,
thought nothing, understood nothing. They ate
anything that they could chew or swallow: flowers,
roots, slugs, beetles, and such fish, birds, or reptiles
as they had the wit to kill; perhaps they filled their
stomachs with mud upon occasion, as many savages
are said to do; perhaps they actually were cannibals,
and, like some of the Fuegians, ate their dead relatives
instead of burying them. Altogether it was a sad
spectacle; sadder still if one reflects that they may
possibly have had in their veins the blood of a once
powerful people.</p>
<p>As the strangers advanced, the Indians drew off,
walking backwards and at a similar pace to theirs.
The bank gave on to a shrub-dotted plain, covered
with flowers of all colours, and, in patches, with
giant thistles. Snipe started up from the ground at
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_336' name='page_336'></a>336</span>
the sound of the voices; in the distance were a few
ostriches and wild cattle; but as the only weapon
which the natives seemed to possess was this kind of
club with a fish-bone point bound to it with a strip
of fish-skin, it is probable that neither birds nor
beasts suffered much at their hands.</p>
<p>This visit was not thrown away, for Hutchinson
soon found enough wild cotton to encourage the hope
that there was more in the neighbourhood. Meanwhile,
Ruberta asked how the savages caught their fish.
It turned out that they had even forgotten how to
make lines, let alone hooks; they had no boats, and
were dependent on spearing such fish as came under
the banks from time to time. Where the poor souls
lived was a mystery; not a habitation of any sort
was visible. Only once more did they show anger
or animation. Diego was questioning them, when
all of a sudden they stopped and extended their spears,
as if to bar the intruders&rsquo; passage; and, for a moment,
their wooden expression gave place to something
like ferocity and rage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What have you been saying to them?&rdquo; asked
Hutchinson anxiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I merely asked what they had done with their
women and children.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The question was indiscreet, as the explorer could
have told him; but their mode of answering it was
interesting, as showing that the poor fellows had some
little sense of proprietorship, if not of the duty of
protecting those who should be dependent on them.
Most likely they had sent the women and children
away, on finding that strangers were in the neighbourhood&mdash;a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_337' name='page_337'></a>337</span>
sign of suspicion, if not of meditated war,
common among all Indians from the Eskimos to the
Fuegians.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They needn&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;re likely to want to marry
into their tribe,&rdquo; said Ruberta. &ldquo;I think we have
seen about enough of them now. Let&rsquo;s get rid of them.&rdquo;
He drew his revolver and fired into a flock of wild duck
that were making for the water. A startled scream
rose from all the Indians; they turned and fled for
perhaps fifty yards; then stopped and looked back;
but just then the three Zambos who were loitering
on the bank began running towards their employer,
thinking the report was a danger signal; and this
completed the panic of the savages, who fled over the
nearest hill and were seen no more.</p>
<p>The launch proceeded another two days&rsquo; journey
up the river, and this brought the travellers in sight
of the distant peaks of the Andes. It was a positive
relief here to meet with Indians who could help
themselves, after the animal-like beings seen lower
down. They began to pass canoes, and sometimes
neat and prosperous villages peopled by Christian
Guaranis and Quiteños; and now, as Ruberta wanted
to stop and make geological researches, Hutchinson
decided to continue the journey by land, and, taking
Diego with him, agreed to return to the launch in
a few days&rsquo; time.</p>
<p>Diego enlivened the journey; he chatted, hunted,
introduced his master to various wandering Indians,
as well as surprised him by his dexterity in the use
of the bolas. He had consented to leave his paddle,
cooking-pot, and spear in the boat, but could not be
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_338' name='page_338'></a>338</span>
prevailed upon to part with his lassoes, bolas, and
stirrups. Such Indians as he are almost lost without
a horse, and he showed Hutchinson before long that
he meant to have one. As though to keep his hand in,
he practised from time to time on the ostriches with
his bolas, bringing down the ungainly birds with
perfect ease from a distance of sixty or seventy yards.
The weapon used for such work as this was lighter
than that described in the last chapter, and consisted
of only two joined thongs, the balls being pebbles
covered with leather.</p>
<p>At the next village Hutchinson found that an
ox-waggon was about to start for the spot which he
wished to reach, and, having little admiration for the
domestic horses of the neighbourhood, and no ambition
to ride one of the wild ones which Diego was so confident
of catching, he resolved to travel in this manner.
But Diego had a soul above such a conveyance, and,
that very evening, while the oxen were being unyoked,
he stole away towards a small group of horses that
were browsing on the plain. It was becoming a
question of &ldquo;do or die&rdquo; with him now, for every step
was taking the travellers farther from the region
where horses are to be seen in any numbers. The
Consul had many times seen a lasso used from the
saddle, but he could not understand how Master
Diego proposed to catch a horse while he was on foot;
and he watched him eagerly through his field-glass.</p>
<p>Crawling on his belly, the Quiteño patiently worked
his way towards the nearest horse, and no sooner did
the animal turn his back on him, than he sprang up,
and the noose had secured him. So far, so good; but
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_339' name='page_339'></a>339</span>
did Diego expect the animal to follow him like a pup
on the lead, or a donkey in the shafts? thought the
Consul. The horse gave a wild spring, and, for a
second, the Indian was almost dragged off his feet;
then he began to &ldquo;play&rdquo; his capture.</p>
<p>Diego was a fine-looking man, over six feet high,
and with limbs as hard as a stone, though they were
so slender; and he had no hesitation in pitting his
own strength against the horse&rsquo;s. With infinite
patience he stood, the centre of a circle, while the
frightened creature ran off his first fit of energy,
round and round his captor; then, having spied a
clump of trees not far away, the Quiteño let himself
be dragged towards these; and, before the horse
had realised that he was running to his doom, the
lasso had taken a turn round the nearest trunk and
was soon hitched there immovable.</p>
<p>By morning the prisoner was in a humbler frame
of mind, and, under pressure, submitted to be loose-hobbled;
Diego vaulted on to his back without
thought of saddle or bridle, and, holding his mane,
buffeted him so mercilessly over the face and withers,
that Hutchinson was tempted to serve him the same.
Less than half an hour of this management made the
animal sufficiently tractable to submit to being
saddled; and, with the skid-pan stirrups, the rest
was perfectly easy&mdash;and disgusting.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVII</h2>
<h3>BUSINESS AND PLEASURE ON THE LLANOS</h3>
</div>
<p>South America is the land of revolution and
civil war, and Venezuela has not been far behind
the other republics in its indulgence in such
pastimes. In 1864, five out of seven provinces that
had been enrolled the previous year seceded, and
the Commander-in-Chief, General Paez, was kept busy
between subduing seceders and warding off Colombian
invasion.</p>
<p>It is common enough to find an English gentleman
filling any imaginable capacity, from highest to lowest,
in America; but one is scarcely prepared to meet,
on the Llanos, a young Venezuelan speaking or writing
the language of an educated Englishman, and carrying
into his fighting, his hunting and his dealings with
the Indians all the best traditions of manliness and
fair play characteristic of our public schools. Yet
such a man &ldquo;might have been seen&rdquo; (as Ainsworth
or G. P. R. James would say) riding beside the Republican
General as his secretary and aide-de-camp.
This was young Ramon Paez, the General&rsquo;s nephew,
who, on account of his father&rsquo;s exile, was brought
up mainly in England, and educated at Stonyhurst;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_341' name='page_341'></a>341</span>
and who, after taking an Arts degree at London University,
returned to his own country and joined his
uncle in the north-west of Venezuela, in 1866.</p>
<p>Late in the year, while they were quieting the
Colombian frontier, he received a commission which
would have made an English aide-de-camp stare;
his uncle sent for him, and told him without preliminary
that he was to ride back to the Orinoco plains,
catch three thousand wild horses, and bring them to
the camp for the extra cavalrymen who had enlisted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take three troopers with you; it is all I can spare;
it will probably be enough.&rdquo; Of course, Ramon Paez
did not question his last remark, but he had his own
opinion on the subject. &ldquo;You can take three extra
horses; two to carry your provisions, and the third
you can load up with presents for the Indians.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So; it was the Indians who were to do the work!
Young Paez had almost left them out of his calculations.</p>
<p>The presents&mdash;beads, knives, briar pipes, condemned
small arms, etc.&mdash;were soon collected and packed,
and the four men rode away in search of natives and
horses. The Indians were not easy to find; at least
not the Indians of the right sort; of the wrong sort&mdash;idlers,
camp-followers, and hangers-on, who had
quarrelled with hard work the day they were born
and never become reconciled&mdash;there were plenty.
But it was not till they reached the Orinoco and had
travelled down it for a couple of days, that they came
across any who looked like the men they wanted.
These were fishing, and the workmanlike way in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_342' name='page_342'></a>342</span>
which they went about their task augured well for
the success of the aide-de-camp&rsquo;s mission.</p>
<p>He entered into conversation with them and learned
that, some miles farther south, horses of a very fine
breed were plentiful; and, after a hint from him
as to pecuniary reward and a probable distribution
of presents, they agreed to refer the matter to their
cacique, and if he should raise no objection, to start
on the morrow.</p>
<p>The young Venezuelan watched the native sport
with keen interest, for, till lately, he had seen nothing
of the kind since his childhood. The net&mdash;a kind of
ground-seine&mdash;was rectangular, with a square flap at
either end, and the back weighted at right angles to
the bottom; in fact, while it was down, it might be
likened in shape to an enormous box which has had
the lid and one of its sides removed. It was shot from
two canoes about fifty yards from the bank, its back
and ends being stiffened and kept in place by canes,
or lengths of <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">palma morice</i> stalks. When it had been
down for about half an hour, the two canoes&mdash;strictly
keeping pace with one another&mdash;moved so slowly
towards the bank, that scarcely a ripple was made;
the tow-lines were thrown ashore, and the net dragged
into the shallow.</p>
<p>Considering the marvellous variety of fish which
the Orinoco possesses, the result was a little disappointing
to an onlooker; for the catch, though
very large, consisted almost entirely of but two kinds:
the electric eel, and a creature peculiar to tropical
South America&mdash;the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">payara</i>&mdash;the size of a small
salmon; this had its lower jaw supplied with fangs,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_343' name='page_343'></a>343</span>
which the Indians said cut like razors. As the net
was pulled into the shallows, an Indian waved his
hand warningly to the four soldiers who were standing
by.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be careful, gentlemen; beware of the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">caribe</i>!
Pray stand farther back; your red sashes will attract
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As he spoke, some small fish leapt out of the
water and into the net. &ldquo;Quick; quick with the
forks!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Half a dozen long slender canes, each ending in two
metal prongs like those of a carving-fork, were instantly
produced, and it was soon plain enough why such
implements were required. Those few little green
fish, so beautifully barred with red and orange, were
like bulls in a china shop; they leapt, wriggled, or
swam about the net, biting first the fish and then the
net as viciously as rats; and Paez stared to see mesh
after mesh snapped through before the Indians could
eject them with their forks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If they could have got near you they would have
bitten you in the same manner,&rdquo; said the principal
of the fishermen, when he had got rid of the last of
the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">caribes</i>. &ldquo;Anything red will attract them. We
dare not attempt to swim a spurred horse through
here, for he would be bitten to death, or till he was
mad, before he reached the other side. I have seen
a white man killed by them, merely because he
happened to have a red scratch on his leg when he
entered the water.&rdquo;</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>The cacique was interviewed, and not only granted
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_344' name='page_344'></a>344</span>
permission for the whole tribe to go on the hunting
expedition, but announced his own intention of going;
and, early the following morning, they all started
southwards with a good supply of lassoes. The
Indians&mdash;one of the Cariban tribes&mdash;were the finest
horsemen Paez had seen; and this was the more
noteworthy, inasmuch as the Caribs as a whole care
little for riding; many of those of the forest regions
and of the Central American mountains have never
seen such a thing as a horse; and we know that the
cavalry of the Spanish adventurers terrified the
sixteenth-century Caribs as much as Pyrrhus&rsquo; elephants
disconcerted the Romans and their horses. Yet these
Venezuelan natives rode as if they had been born on
horseback, and made no more ado of eating their
dinner while they were in the saddle than as though
it had been an arm-chair.</p>
<p>The nearer the cavalcade drew to the softer grass
of the Llano, the more wild horses they saw; and
Paez, who had never yet used a lasso, was for making
his maiden effort on one of these; till the cacique
warned him that &ldquo;horses can tell things to each other;&rdquo;
and that these scouts, if chased, would easily escape
and caution the larger herds, thereby lengthening
out the hunt by an extra week or more.</p>
<p>But at length they saw enough of the animals to
satisfy the most wary of caciques; they could only
be counted by the herd; it seemed as though all the
horses in America had been turned out to grass on
this particular spot. From the matter-of-fact way
in which the three troopers went to work, the chief
saw at once that they had little to learn from his tribe;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_345' name='page_345'></a>345</span>
but he bade Paez, in fatherly fashion, to keep close
to him and &ldquo;watch how he did it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young officer&rsquo;s riding was perfect; but, after
his first one or two efforts with the lasso, he was
tempted to forswear horse-catching. The thing would
not go right; either he ran his noose too small, or too
large, or it fell short, or missed wildly; or, worse still,
got in the way of the other hunters, so that they gave
him a wide berth. However, he persevered, and
towards the close of the first day, actually succeeded
in dropping the noose over the head of a fine black
stallion; and in imagination he saw himself bestriding
him proudly, to the envy of all his mess. But the
beautiful creature, finding the thong about him,
gave a leap that seemed to tear his captor&rsquo;s saddle
from under him; then another, that almost pulled
the ridden horse off his feet; then sped across the
plain as though he moved on wings.</p>
<p>Ramon Paez was certainly as strong as most young
men of one-and-twenty who lead active outdoor lives,
and he had distinguished himself in every variety of
English sport from boxing to ferreting; but he could
no more stop or haul in this wild horse, than he could
have lassoed the Flying Dutchman. The line was as
taut as a fiddle-string, and his own mount, unused to
such diversions, was being drawn along irresistibly.
How much farther did the outraged beast intend to
drag horse and rider?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let him run himself out, Señor,&rdquo; bawled one of
his troopers, as the stallion fled past the outer line of
hunters.</p>
<p>The recommendation was superfluous, for this was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_346' name='page_346'></a>346</span>
the very thing the noble animal seemed to intend
doing. He galloped another half-mile, then changed
his mind, as though the strangulation were beginning
to tell on him. He swung straight round as if resigned
to the notion of going back to the rest, hesitated, then
caught the slackening thong in his teeth and bit at
it as savagely as a wild ass. Naturally the beginner
at once turned his own horse, meaning to pay his
prisoner out in his own coin; and spurring vigorously,
headed towards the central part of the hunt. But this
did not please the irate captive, and, after useless
efforts to stand&mdash;first on his dignity and then on his
head, he made a dead weight of himself for an instant,
then took several successive bounds forward, easily
outstripping his tormentor and slackening the pressure
of the noose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is the brute going to dance?&rdquo; Don Paez asked
himself wrathfully.</p>
<p>This was just what the brute was going to do; not
after the common or circus fashion, but with the fixed
idea of crushing the lad&rsquo;s arm with his great jaws.
The young man&rsquo;s fine horsemanship was the only
thing that could now save him from a bite which
would not only mangle a limb, but would probably
lead to blood-poisoning&mdash;a disease not exactly sought
after in England, and almost sure to be fatal in the
tropics. He backed, and the line tightened; but the
stallion was on him again in another spring. He
backed once more, dodged to the right, to the left,
waved his arm at the infuriated creature, but to no
purpose; and, though he would have bitten his
tongue out before he would own himself beaten, by
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_347' name='page_347'></a>347</span>
shouting for help, he felt that he was playing a losing
game. There was just one chance left for him, and
that was to spur his already enfeebled horse to a
gallop and race his antagonist.</p>
<p>Never did Derby competitor work a horse more
recklessly; Don Paez spurred and smote, smote and
spurred, and only to lose at one minute the start he
had gained the minute before; only just now he had
been endeavouring might and main to slacken the
lasso; now he would have given a five-pound note
to feel it taut. Suddenly his horse seemed to turn
round like a wheel, he had a confused vision of the
sky falling on him, then of the earth coming up to
meet him, and he and the horse lay on the ground
together. He had obeyed his instinct to kick himself
free from the stirrups, and so fell clear of the horse
and escaped with only a severe shaking.</p>
<p>Then he looked up and saw the cause of his fall;
an old Carib, who had watched his struggle from a
distance, had pegged down his own capture, galloped
across and neatly dropped a second lasso over the
head of the rebellious wild horse.</p>
<p>The next few nights, all camped out on the Llano,
and by the end of the week, were ready to start for
the camp with fully three thousand horses. South
American ways with animals are not our ways, and
Indian methods of taming and transporting horses are
not such as English readers love to hear of;<a name='FNanchor_n0005' id='FNanchor_n0005'></a><a href='#Footnote_n0005' class='fnanchor'>[5]</a> it will
be sufficient to say that, for transport, the captives
were yoked up in long teams, each horse being thong-hobbled
on his fore-legs.</p>

<p>Horse-hunting was not the only species of sport
which Don Paez witnessed among the Caribs. On the
journey to the camp, it became necessary to replenish
the food-supply, and he accompanied six of the Indians
on one of their curious deer-hunts. As a preliminary,
the hunters made a call at a native village and each
returned with a small bundle in his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are our masks,&rdquo; said the cacique, who was
of the party. &ldquo;Some of our people hunt with an ox,
but you will see that the mask is as effective. I have
brought one for you, Señor Commandante. Will you
put it on?&rdquo;</p>

<span class='smcap'>Crane Stalking-Masks</span><br />
<br />
On the llanos the Indians use masks made of the head and feathers of the crane, then, imitating the actions of the bird searching for snakes and other reptiles among the reeds and grasses of the river bank, wait until the unsuspecting deer come down to drink, when they form an easy target for their arrows.<br />
</p>
</div>
<p>Paez had already humoured the Indians by leaving
his gun at the camp and bringing a bow and arrows,
about which he knew as little as they of gunpowder.
But when the cacique produced a not too sweet-smelling
head-dress of brown and white feathers,
adorned with the bill of a <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">cariama</i> (a species of crane),
he thought the good man was rather overstraining his
willingness to become a savage. However, he put it
on, and took up his bow and arrows, but so awkwardly
that the cacique hinted that, on this occasion, he might
like to be a mere spectator.</p>
<p>The masks, as worn by men who knew the workings
thereof, were very satisfactory disguises; when the
Indians had fallen on their knees with their heads
bent, they might easily be mistaken in the distance
for cranes feeding; and in this guise they crawled
down towards the edge of the river just before the deer
came down to drink. Paez, concealed in the long grass,
had an excellent view of the proceedings, and could
well understand, at that distance, how the unsuspecting
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_349' name='page_349'></a>349</span>
game might fall into the snare. The &ldquo;cranes,&rdquo; with
their backs to the water and their heads bobbing so
as to make the pendent bill move as if in search of the
small snakes or other reptiles beloved of such birds,
waited till a good-sized herd came within range;
then the six bow-strings twanged, and six deer lay
dead or helpless, while their startled brethren fled
across the plain; and six more of these were brought
down by a second volley before they could get out of
reach.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No boy will be able to resist the delights of this book, full to the brim of instructive
and wonderful matter.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>British Weekly.</i></p>
<p>&ldquo;This book has kept your reviewer awake when he reasonably expected to be otherwise
engaged. We do not remember coming across a more fascinating volume, even to
a somewhat blasé reader whose business it is to read all that comes in his way. The
marvels, miracles they should be called, of the modern workshop are here exploited by
Mr. Williams for the benefit of readers who have not the opportunity of seeing these
wonders or the necessary mathematical knowledge to understand a scientific treatise
on their working. Only the simplest language is used and every effort is made, by
illustration or by analogy, to make sufficiently clear to the non-scientific reader how
the particular bit of machinery works and what its work really is. Delicate instruments,
calculating machines, workshop machinery, portable tools, the pedrail, motors
ashore and afloat, fire engines, automatic machines, sculpturing machines&mdash;these are
a few of the chapters which crowd this splendid volume.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Educational News.</i></p>
<p>&ldquo;It is difficult to make descriptions of machinery and mechanism interesting, but
Mr. Williams has the enviable knack of doing so, and it is hardly possible to open this
book at any page without turning up something which you feel you must read; and
then you cannot stop till you come to the end of the chapter.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Electricity.</i></p>
<p>&ldquo;This book is full of interest and instruction, and is a welcome addition to Messrs.
Seeley and Company&rsquo;s Romance Series.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Leeds Mercury.</i></p>
<p>&ldquo;A book of absorbing interest for the boy with a mechanical turn, and indeed for
the general reader.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Educational Times.</i></p>
<p>&ldquo;An instructive and well-written volume.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Hobbies.</i></p>
